For a more extended example, here is an input Dictionary, assigned into a variable x:\nx = Dictionary(\"a\", 17, \"b\", 1:5, \"c\", c(\"foo\", \"bar\"),\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"d\", Dictionary(\"seq\", 1.5:5),\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"e\", Dictionary()); and here is the result of x.serialize(\"json\"), omitting the enclosing quotes that would indicate that this is a string value:\n\"a\"=17;\"b\"=1 2 3 4 5;\"c\"=\"foo\" \"bar\";\"d\"={\"seq\"=1.5 2.5 3.5 4.5;};\"e\"={}; The \"pretty\" format is intended for human-readable output, for purposes such as debugging output.\u00a0 It is similar to the \"slim\" format, but (1)\u00a0it prints an enclosing set of braces at the top level, (2)\u00a0it adds newlines inside braces, (3)\u00a0it tracks an indentation level that increments for nested dictionaries, (4)\u00a0it adds whitespace it some positions for readability, such as around the equals signs that separate keys from values, and (5)\u00a0it omits the semicolon at the end of a value, adding a newline instead.\u00a0 No facility for parsing \"pretty\" serializations back into Eidos is presently provided. For the same extended example Dictionary as above, here is the result of x.serialize(\"pretty\"), again omitting the enclosing quotes that would indicate that this is a string value:\n{\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \"a\" = 17\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \"b\" = 1 2 3 4 5\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \"c\" = \"foo\" \"bar\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \"d\" = {\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"seq\" = 1.5 2.5 3.5 4.5\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 }\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \"e\" = {}\n\n} The \"json\" format, introduced in Eidos 2.7 (SLiM 3.7), provides serialization of the Dictionary into the standard JSON format, which may not be quite as brief or human-readable, but which can be used as a standard interchange format and read by the Dictionary() constructor in Eidos as well as by many other programs.\u00a0 For example, a Dictionary with a key \"key1\" with integer value 1:3 and key \"key2\" with string value \"value2\" would produce the JSON serialization '{\"key1\":[1,2,3],\"key2\":[\"value2\"]}', where the outer single quotes are not part of the serialization itself, but are indicating that the serialization is a string value.\u00a0 Note that since all Eidos values are vectors, even singleton values are serialized into JSON as arrays by Eidos; the hope is that this will make automated parsing of these JSON strings easier, since the singleton case will not have to be special-cased.\u00a0 For example, Dictionary(\"a\", 1, \"b\", Dictionary(\"x\", 2)) would be serialized into JSON as '{\"a\":[1],\"b\":[{\"x\":[2]}]}'.\u00a0 Note that dictionaries that use integer keys cannot be serialized into JSON, because JSON does not support integer keys.\u00a0 Documentation on the JSON format can be found online. The \"csv\" and \"tsv\" formats produce standard comma-separated value (CSV) or tab-separated value (TSV) data.\u00a0 These formats are primarily intended for output from DataFrame, since that class is used to represent the sort of data tables that CSV/TSV are typically used for; but it may be used with Dictionary too, particularly if it is being used to represent a data table with ragged columns (missing values will just be skipped over, producing two commas or two tabs in sequence).\u00a0 Values of type string will always be quoted, with double quotes (with a repeated double quote used to indicate the presence of a double quote inside a string value, as usual in CSV); values of other types never will.\u00a0 Decimal points (not decimal commas, regardless of system localization) will always be used for float values, and will never be used for integer values.\u00a0 Values of logical type will be serialized as TRUE or FALSE, without quotes.\u00a0 A header line providing the names of the columns (i.e., the keys of the target Dictionary) will always be generated; those column names will also be quoted (if the keys of the dictionary are type string; integer keys are not quoted).\u00a0 One string element will be generated for each row of the target, plus one string element for the header line; newlines will not be present in the resulting string vector unless newlines were present within the string values in the Dictionary.\u00a0 The resulting data, if written to a file, should be readable in Eidos using readCSV() (as long as there are no ragged columns or missing values), as well as in other software such as R and Excel."

This is a vectorized version of setValue(); dicts.setValuesVectorized(\"key\", values) is equivalent to for (dict in dicts, value in values) dict.setValue(\"key\", value), but is faster since the for loop is vectorized internally.\u00a0 The speedup is not enormous, however; the larger reason for the existence of this method is convenience. The values are set into the target dictionaries in exactly the same way as the setValue() method would do; see that method for details about string versus integer keys, scoping restrictions for values of type object, and so forth.\u00a0 Note that it is not possible to remove values from the target dictionaries, however, since it is not possible to pass NULL as a value here."
