                "description": " Returns the ancestral nucleotide sequence originally supplied to initializeAncestralNucleotides(), including any sequence changes due to nucleotide mutations that have fixed and substituted.  This nucleotide sequence is the reference sequence for positions in a haplosome that do not contain a nucleotide-based mutation.  The range of the returned sequence may be constrained by a start position given in start and/or an end position given in end; nucleotides will be returned from start to end, inclusive.  The default value of NULL for start and end represent the first and last base positions of the chromosome, respectively. The format of the returned sequence is controlled by the format parameter.  A format of \"string\" will return the sequence as a singleton string (e.g., \"TATA\").  A format of \"char\" will return a string vector with one element per nucleotide (e.g., \"T\", \"A\", \"T\", \"A\").  A format of \"integer\" will return an integer vector with values A=0, C=1, G=2, T=3 (e.g., 3, 0, 3, 0).  If the sequence returned is likely to be long, the \"string\" format will be the most memory-efficient, and may also be the fastest (but may be harder to work with). For purposes related to interpreting the nucleotide sequence as a coding sequence, a format of \"codon\" is also supported.  This format will return an integer vector with values from 0 to 63, based upon successive nucleotide triplets in the sequence (which, for this format, must have a length that is a multiple of three).  The codon value for a given nucleotide triplet XYZ is 16X + 4Y + Z, where X, Y, and Z have the usual values A=0, C=1, G=2, T=3.  For example, the triplet AAA has a codon value of 0, AAC is 1, AAG is 2, AAT is 3, ACA is 4, and on upward to TTT which is 63.  If the nucleotide sequence AACACATTT is requested in codon format, the codon vector 1 4 63 will therefore be returned.  These codon values can be useful in themselves; they can also be passed to codonToAminoAcid() to translate them into the corresponding amino acid sequence if desired."

It is generally recommended that the parent individual be supplied to this method, but parent is NULL by default.  The individual supplied in parent is used for two purposes.  First, in sexual models that define separate recombination rate maps for males versus females, the sex of parent will be used to determine which map is used; in this case, a non-NULL value must be supplied for parent, since the choice of recombination rate map must be determined.  Second, in models that define recombination() callbacks, parent is used to determine the various pseudo-parameters that are passed to recombination() callbacks (individual, haplosome1, haplosome2, subpop), and the subpopulation to which parent belongs is used to select which recombination() callbacks are applicable; given the necessity of this information, recombination() callbacks will not be called as a side effect of this method if parent is NULL.  Apart from these two uses, parent is not used, and the caller does not guarantee that the generated breakpoints will actually be used to recombine the haplosomes of parent in particular.  If a recombination() callback is called, haplosome1 for that callback will always be the first haplosome of parent for the chromosome; in other words, drawBreakpoints() will always treat the first haplosome of a homologous pair as the initial copy strand.  If the caller wishes to randomly choose an initial copy strand (which is usually desirable), they should do that themselves (note that the addRecombinant() and addMultiRecombinant() methods have a flag to facilitate this)."

The sep parameter specifies the separator between data values within a row.  The default of \",\" will generate a “comma-separated value” (CSV) file, while passing sep=\"\\t\" will use a tab separator instead to generate a “tab-separated value” (TSV) file.  Other values for sep may also be used, but are less standard. LogTable supports periodic automatic logging of a new row of data, enabled by supplying a non-NULL value for logInterval.  In this case, a new row will be logged (as if logRow() were called on the LogFile) at the end of every logInterval ticks (just before the tick counter increments, in both WF and nonWF models), starting at the end of the tick in which the LogFile was created.  A logInterval of 1 will cause automatic logging at the end of every tick, whereas a logInterval of NULL disables automatic logging.  Automatic logging can always be disabled or reconfigured later with the LogFile method setLogInterval(), or logging can be triggered manually by calling logRow(). When compression is enabled, LogFile flushes new data lazily by default, for performance reasons, buffering data for multiple rows before writing to disk.  Passing a non-NULL value for flushInterval requests a flush every flushInterval rows (with a value of 1 providing unbuffered operation).  Note that flushing very frequently will likely result in both lower performance and a larger final file size (in one simple test, 48943 bytes instead of 4280 bytes, or more than a 10× increase in size).  Alternatively, passing a very large value for flushInterval will effectively disable automatic flushing, except at the end of the simulation (but be aware that this may use a large amount of memory for large log files).  In any case, the log file will be created immediately, with its requested initial contents; the initial write is not buffered.  When compression is not enabled, the flushInterval setting is ignored. The header parameter controls whether a header line is written out at the beginning of logging.  If it is T (the default), a header line is written out; if F, no header is written.  Suppressing the header output can be useful if you are using LogFile to append data to an existing file that already has a header line. The LogFile documentation discusses how to configure and use LogFile to write out the data you are interested in from your simulation."

The first way to specify the tick set is with start and end parameter values; block will then execute from start to end, inclusive. The second way to specify the tick set is using the ticks parameter, specifying each tick in which the block should execute.  The vector supplied for ticks does not need to be in sorted order, but it must not contain any duplicates. It can sometimes be better to handle script block scheduling in other ways.  If an early() event needs to execute every tenth tick over the whole duration of a long model run, for example, it might not be advisable to use a call like community.rescheduleScriptBlock(s1, ticks=seq(10, 100000, 10)) for that purpose, since that would make things complicated for SLiM’s scheduler.  Instead, it might be preferable to add a test such as if (community.tick % 10 != 0) return; at the beginning of the event.  It is legal to reschedule a script block while the block is executing; a call like community.rescheduleScriptBlock(self, community.tick + 10, community.tick + 10); made inside a given block would therefore also cause the block to execute every tenth tick, although this sort of self-rescheduling code is probably harder to read, maintain, and debug. Whichever way of specifying the tick set is used, block may continue to be executed during the current tick cycle stage even after it has been rescheduled, unless it is made inactive using its active property, and similarly, the block may not execute during the current tick cycle stage if it was not already scheduled to do so.  Rescheduling script blocks during the tick and tick cycle stage in which they are executing, or in which they are intended to execute, should be avoided.  Also, note that script blocks which are open-ended (i.e., with no specified end tick), are not used in determining whether the end of the simulation has been reached (because then the simulation would run forever). Note that new script blocks can also be created and scheduled using the register...() methods of Community and Species; by using the same source as a template script block, the template can be duplicated and scheduled for different ticks, perhaps with modifications or variations.  In multispecies models, note that blocks may not run due to their species or ticks specifier, even in ticks in which they are scheduled to run."

The new mutations created by this method are returned, even if their actual addition is prevented by the mutation stacking policy (see the mutationStackPolicy property of MutationType).  However, the order of the mutations in the returned vector is not guaranteed to be the same as the order in which the values are specified in parameter vectors, unless the position parameter is specified in ascending order.  In other words, pre-sorting the parameters to this method into ascending order by position, using order() and subsetting, will guarantee that the order of the returned vector of mutations corresponds to the order of elements in the parameters to this method; otherwise, no such guarantee exists. Beginning in SLiM 2.1, this is a class method, not an instance method.  This means that it does not get multiplexed out to all of the elements of the receiver (which would add a different new mutation to each element); instead, it is performed as a single operation, adding the same new mutation objects to all of the elements of the receiver.  Before SLiM 2.1, to add the same mutations to multiple haplosomes, it was necessary to call addNewDrawnMutation() on one of the haplosomes, and then add the returned Mutation object to all of the other haplosomes using addMutations().  That is not necessary in SLiM 2.1 and later, because of this change (although doing it the old way does no harm and produces identical behavior).  Pre-2.1 code that actually relied upon the old multiplexing behavior will no longer work correctly (but this is expected to be an extremely rare pattern of usage). Calling this will normally affect the fitness values calculated at the end of the current tick (but not sooner); if you want current fitness values to be affected, you can call the Species method recalculateFitness() – but see the documentation of that method for caveats. Note that in nonWF models that use tree-sequence recording, mutations cannot be added to an individual after the tick in which the individual is created (i.e., when the age of the individual is greater than 0), to prevent the possibility of inconsistencies in the recorded tree sequence."

For example, calls for (non-null) Y haplosomes in males will be emitted as 0 or 1, whereas calls for the (null) Y haplosomes in females will be emitted as ~.  For an intrinsically diploid chromosome, the pair of target haplosomes for a given individual is used to generate a call for that individual, but null haplosomes are allowed (in the patterns expected by SLiM given the chromosome type).  For example, a pair of non-null haplosomes for an X chromosome will be emitted as a diploid call (such as 1|0) for a female (XX), but if the second haplosome of the pair is a null haplosome, the pair will be emitted as a haploid call (0 or 1) for a male (X).  If the first haplosome of the pair were a null haplosome for an X chromosome, an error would be raised, since that is not an allowed pattern in SLiM (as discussed in the documentation for the Chromosome class).  For a diploid autosome of type \"A\", however, any pattern is legal, but the VCF format cannot distinguish between a non-null haplosome first and a null haplosome second, versus a null haplosome first and a non-null haplosome second; both will be emitted as a haploid call (0 or 1).  For a diploid autosome of type \"A\", if both haplosomes are null the call will be ~.  The VCF specification does not actually seem to discuss sex chromosomes, but this design is intended to follow standard usage. With groupAsIndividuals being F, the focal chromosome is treated as being intrinsically haploid whether it is or not; each haplosome will be called as a haploid sample whether the chromosome type is diploid or haploid.  This provides more detailed and accurate information; the exact state of each haplosome will be represented with either 0, 1, or (for null haplosomes) ~, rather than the state of a pair of haplosomes being represented as a single call in a way that can sometimes be ambiguous, as discussed above.  However, the resulting output might confuse some VCF parsers that expect diploid calls for individuals, and it will not be as obvious which calls in the output belong to a given diploid individual.

This method and the readIndividualsFromVCF() method of Individual provide two alternative ways of reading VCF data, focused in the perspective of either haplosomes (this method) or individuals (the Individual method).  See the documentation of readIndividualsFromVCF() for discussion of the pros and cons of each approach; that discussion will not be duplicated here. SLiM’s VCF parsing is quite primitive.  The header is parsed only inasmuch as SLiM looks to see whether SLiM-specific VCF fields are defined or not; the rest of the header information is ignored.  Call lines are assumed to follow the format: The CHROM field is largely ignored, but readHaplosomesFromVCF() does check that its value is identical across all call lines, to prevent the genetic data for more than one chromosome from being glommed together nonsensically; the input VCF file must contain data for just a single chromosome.  In single-chromosome models the CHROM field is not otherwise checked or validated.  In multi-chromosome models, readHaplosomesFromVCF() imposes some additional restrictions.  First, all haplosomes in the target vector must be associated with the same single focal chromosome.  Second, the CHROM field for every call line in the VCF file must match the symbol property of that focal chromosome; the VCF file must indicate that it specifically matches the focal chromosome associated with the target haplosomes.  These restrictions boil down to the fact that readHaplosomesFromVCF() only reads data for a single chromosome.  If you wish to read multi-chromosome VCF data into a multi-chromosome SLiM model, the readIndividualsFromVCF() method provided by the Individual class supports that functionality (because it can work at the level of individuals, rather than haplosomes, making it possible to match calls to the corresponding haplosomes in a reasonable way).  Alternatively, you can call readHaplosomesFromVCF() multiple times to read data for different chromosomes one by one. The ID, QUAL, FILTER, and FORMAT fields are ignored, and information in the genotype fields beyond the GT genotype subfield are also ignored.  SLiM’s own VCF annotations are honored; in particular, mutations will be created using the given values of MID, S, PO, TO, and MT if those subfields are present, and DOM, if it is present, must match the dominance coefficient of the mutation type.  The parameter mutationType (a MutationType object or id) will be used for any mutations that have no supplied mutation type id in the MT subfield; if mutationType would be used but is NULL an error will result.  Mutation IDs supplied in MID will be used if no mutation IDs have been used in the simulation so far; if any have been used, it is difficult for SLiM to guarantee that there are no conflicts, so a warning will be emitted and the MID values will be ignored.  If selection coefficients are not supplied with the S subfield, they will be drawn from the mutation type used for the mutation.  If a population of origin is not supplied with the PO subfield, -1 will be used.  If a tick of origin is not supplied with the TO subfield (or a generation of origin GO field, which was the SLiM convention before SLiM 4), the current tick will be used. REF and ALT must always be comprised of simple nucleotides (A/C/G/T) rather than values representing indels or other complex states.  Beyond this, the handling of the REF and ALT fields depends upon several factors.  In non-nucleotide-based models, we have the first case: (1) These fields are ignored, although they are still checked for conformance.  In nucleotide-based models, when a header definition for SLiM’s NONNUC tag is present (as when nucleotide-based output is generated by SLiM) there are two further possibilities, given as (2) and (3) here: (2) If a NONNUC field is present in the INFO field the call line is taken to represent a non-nucleotide-based mutation, and REF and ALT are again ignored; in this case the mutation type used must be non-nucleotide-based.  (3) If a NONNUC field is not present the call line is taken to represent a nucleotide-based mutation; in this case, the mutation type used must be nucleotide-based, and the specified reference nucleotide must match the existing ancestral nucleotide at the given position.  Finally, in nucleotide-based models, when a header definition for SLiM’s NONNUC tag is not present (as when loading a non-SLiM-generated VCF file), there is a remaining possibility: (4) The mutation type used will govern the way nucleotides are handled.  In this case, if the mutation type used for a mutation is nucleotide-based, the nucleotide provided in the VCF file for that allele will be used, whereas if the mutation type is non-nucleotide-based, the nucleotide provided will be ignored. If multiple alleles using the same nucleotide at the same position are specified in the VCF file, a separate mutation will be created for each, mirroring SLiM’s behavior with independent mutational lineages when writing VCF.  The MULTIALLELIC flag is ignored by readHaplosomesFromVCF(); call lines for mutations at the same base position in the same haplosome will result in stacked mutations whether or not MULTIALLELIC is present. The target haplosomes correspond, in order, to the haploid or diploid calls provided for i0…iN (the sample IDs) in the VCF file.  Null haplosomes in the target vector will be skipped, and will not be used to correspond to any of the calls for i0…iN; however, care should be taken in this case that the haplosomes in the VCF file correspond to the target haplosomes in the manner desired. A call of ~ (an ASCII tilde character) for an individual i0…iN is taken to indicate that that individual possesses no genetic information for the chromosome; it lacks that chromosome entirely.  For example, if the VCF file represents Y-chromosome data, female individuals should have calls of ~.  This is treated differently than a call of 0  or 0|0; a call of 0 matches that call to a non-null target haplosome (but does not add the called mutation to that haplosome), and a call of 0|0 matches two non-null target haplosomes (but does not add the called mutation to either), whereas a call of ~ is simply skipped, without matching to any haplosome in the target vector, mirroring the fact that readHaplosomesFromVCF() skips over null haplosomes in the target haplosome vector.  (When reading Y-chromosome data, a female’s null Y haplosome could be omitted from the target haplosome vector, or it could be present since it would be skipped anyway – as stated above, all null haplosomes are skipped.)  Note that these semantics using ~ are non-standard; the VCF standard does not seem to say anything about how sex chromosomes should be represented (or anything about other types of chromosomes that might be absent from some individuals), so the usage of ~ was invented for SLiM.  This is an area where standardization is very much needed."

Removing mutations will normally affect the fitness values calculated at the end of the current tick; if you want current fitness values to be affected, you can call the Species method recalculateFitness() – but see the documentation of that method for caveats. The optional parameter substitute was added in SLiM 2.2, with a default of F for backward compatibility.  If substitute is T, Substitution objects will be created for all of the removed mutations so that they are recorded in the simulation as having fixed, just as if they had reached fixation and been removed by SLiM’s own internal machinery.  This will occur regardless of whether the mutations have in fact fixed, regardless of the convertToSubstitution property of the relevant mutation types, and regardless of whether all copies of the mutations have even been removed from the simulation (making it possible to create Substitution objects for mutations that are still segregating).  It is up to the caller to perform whatever checks are necessary to preserve the integrity of the simulation’s records.  Typically substitute will only be set to T in the context of calls like sim.subpopulations.haplosomes.removeMutations(muts, T), such that the substituted mutations are guaranteed to be entirely removed from circulation.  As mentioned above, substitute may not be T if mutations is NULL."

This method and the readHaplosomesFromVCF() method of Haplosome provide two alternative ways of reading VCF data, focused on the perspective of either individuals (this method) or haplosomes (the Haplosome method).  As described above, this method draws a correspondence between VCF samples and individuals, whereas the Haplosome method draws a correspondence between VCF calls and haplosomes.  For example, if a VCF call line contained a series of calls like “1|1 0|1 1 0 1|0” this method would see that as calls for five individuals, three of which are diploid for the chromosome being called, and two of which are haploid.  That would make sense if, for example, the chromosome being called is an X chromosome; the diploid individuals would be females, the haploid individuals would be males.  The vector of target individuals would need to contain two females, then two males, and then a female, so that the structure of the calls matched the haplosome structure of the individuals, or an error would result.  The readHaplosomesFromVCF() method of Haplosome, on the other hand, would see that same series of calls as corresponding to eight haplosomes, and would assign each call to the corresponding non-null target haplosome, without regard to whether the VCF’s grouping into diploid and haploid calls corresponded to any coherent structure of individuals in the SLiM model.  Each approach has advantages and disadvantages.  This method provides much more error-checking and safety when your intention is to read individual-level data from VCF; it can check that the ploidy in the VCF data matches the ploidy of each target individual, and that diploid calls like 1|1 get assigned to the two haplosomes of a single individual correctly.  The readHaplosomesFromVCF() method of Haplosome does not perform such checks, and can push VCF data into any arbitrary set of haplosomes, so it provides more power and flexibility, but less error-checking and less intelligence. Because this method works at the level of individuals, it can read VCF data associated with multiple chromosomes into a multi-chromosome SLiM model and place mutations into the correct haplosomes of each individual based upon the CHROM column of the VCF file (which readHaplosomesFromVCF() cannot do).  For this to work, the values in the CHROM column of the call lines must correspond exactly to chromosome symbols in the SLiM model, as provided to initializeChromosome().  The call lines in the input file may be in any order (they do not have to be sorted by CHROM value, or any other such requirement).  The vector of mutations returned will contain all of the mutations created; when reading multi-chromosome data, that returned vector will therefore contain a mix of mutations with different associated chromosomes.  Alternatively, it would work equally well to make a separate call to readIndividualsFromVCF() for each chromosome, providing each call with a separate VCF file that contains only the mutations associated with one chromosome; in that case, each call would return only the mutations added to the chromosome associated with that call, which might be more convenient if post-processing of the returned mutations is necessary. As in readHaplosomesFromVCF(), a call of ~ represents the fact that an individual has no genetic information for the chromosome being called; for example, a call line for a mutation on a Y chromosome should have haploid calls for male individuals (they have or do not have the called mutation), and calls of ~ for female individuals (they have no Y haplosome at all).  This convention was invented for SLiM, since the VCF standard does not seem to say anything about how sex chromosomes should be represented (or anything about other types of chromosomes that might be absent from some individuals). The readHaplosomesFromVCF() method’s documentation provides many important details on how SLiM treats various VCF fields during input; those details will not be repeated here, for brevity."

                "description": " Returns a vector containing the degrees of relatedness between the receiver and each of the individuals in individuals.  The relatedness between A and B is always 1.0 if A and B are actually the same individual; this facility works even if SLiM’s optional pedigree tracking is not enabled (in which case all other relatedness values will be 0.0).  Otherwise, if pedigree tracking is turned on with initializeSLiMOptions(keepPedigrees=T), this method will use the pedigree information to construct a relatedness estimate.  The relatedness is calculated based upon the type of the chromosome specified by chromosome (as an integer id, a string symbol, or a Chromosome object); if chromosome is NULL, it is assumed to be the single chromosome present in the model, or if more than one chromosome is present, an error results and the chromosome must be explicitly given. More specifically, this method uses all available pedigree information from the grandparental and parental pedigree records of A and B to compute an estimate of the degree of consanguinity between A and B.  When considering a diploid autosome, siblings have a relatedness of 0.5, as do parents to their children and vice versa; cousins have a relatedness of 0.125; and so forth.  If, according to the pedigree information available, A and B have no blood relationship, the value returned is 0.0.  Note that the value returned by relatedness() is what is called the “coefficient of relationship” between the two individuals (Wright, 1922; https://doi.org/10.1086/279872), and ranges from 0.0 to 1.0. There is another commonly used metric of relatedness, called the “kinship coefficient”, that reflects the probability of identity by descent between two individuals A and B.  In general, it is approximately equal to one-half of the coefficient of relationship; if an approximate estimate of the kinship coefficient is acceptable, especially in models in which individuals are expected to be outbred, you can simply divide relatedness() by two.  However, it should be noted that Wright’s coefficient of relationship is not a measure of the probability of identity by descent, and so it is not exactly double the kinship coefficient; they actually measure different things.  More precisely, the relationship between them is r = 2φ/sqrt((1+fA)(1+fB)), where r is Wright’s coefficient of relatedness, φ is the kinship coefficient, and fA and fB are the inbreeding coefficients of A and B respectively. Note that this relatedness is simply pedigree-based relatedness, and does not necessarily correspond to genetic relatedness, because of the effects of factors like assortment and recombination.  If a metric of actual genetic relatedness is desired, tree-sequence recording can be used after simulation is complete, to compute the exact genetic relatedness between individuals based upon the complete ancestry tree (a topic which is beyond the scope of this manual).  Actual genetic relatedness cannot presently be calculated during a simulation run; the information is implicitly contained in the recorded tree-sequence tables, but calculating it is too computationally expensive to be reasonable. This method assumes that the grandparents (or the parents, if grandparental information is not available) are themselves unrelated and that they are not inbred; this assumption is necessary because we have no information about their parentage, since SLiM’s pedigree tracking information only goes back two generations.  Be aware that in a model where inbreeding or selfing occurs at all (including “incidental selfing”, where a hermaphroditic individual happens to choose itself as a mate), some level of “background relatedness” will be present and this assumption will be violated.  In such circumstances, relatedness() will therefore tend to underestimate the degree of relatedness between individuals, and the greater the degree of inbreeding, the greater the underestimation will be.  If inbreeding is allowed in a model – and particularly if it is common – the results of relatedness() should therefore not be taken as an estimate of absolute relatedness, but can still be useful as an estimate of relative relatedness (indicating that, say, A appears from the information available to be more closely related to B than it is to C). See also sharedParentCount() for a different metric of relatedness."

Note that this is an Eidos class method, somewhat unusually, which allows it to work in a special way when called on a vector of individuals.  When the target vector of individuals is non-singleton, this method can do one of two things.  If position contains just a single point (i.e., is equal in length to the spatial dimensionality of the model), the spatial position of all of the target individuals will be set to the given point.  Alternatively, if position contains one point per target individual (i.e., is equal in length to the number of individuals multiplied by the spatial dimensionality of the model), the spatial position of each target individual will be set to the corresponding point from position (where the point data is concatenated, not interleaved, just as it would be returned by accessing the spatialPosition property on the vector of target individuals).  Calling this method with a position vector of any other length is an error."

More specifically, this method uses the parental pedigree IDs from the pedigree records of a pair of individuals to count the number of shared parents between them, such that full siblings (with all of the same parents) have a count of 2, and half siblings (with half of the same parents) have a count of 1.  If possible parents of the two individuals are A, B, C, and D, then the shared parent count is as follows, for some illustrative examples.  The first column showing the two parents of the first individual, the second column showing the two parents of the second individual; note that the two parents of an individual can be the same due to cloning or selfing: This method does not estimate consanguinity.  For example, if one individual is itself a parent of the other individual, that is irrelevant for this method.  Similarly, in simulations of sex chromosomes, the sexes of the parents are irrelevant, even if no genetic material would have been inherited from a given parent.  See relatedness() for an assessment of pedigree-based relatedness that does estimate the consanguinity of individuals.  The sharedParentCount() method is preferable if your exact question is simply whether individuals are full siblings, half siblings, or non-siblings; in other cases, relatedness() is probably more useful."

The computed value of the integral is not exact; it is calculated by an approximate numerical method designed to be fast, but the error should be fairly small (typically less than 1% from the true value).  A large amount of computation will occur the first time this method is called (perhaps taking more than a second, depending upon hardware), but subsequent calls should be very fast.  This method does not invoke interaction() callbacks; the calculated integrals are only for the interaction function itself, and so will not be accurate if interaction() callbacks modify the relationship between distance and interaction strength.  For this reason, the overhead of the first call will not reoccur when individuals move or when the interaction is re-evaluated; for typical models, the initial overhead will be incurred only once.  The initial overhead will reoccur, however, if the interaction function itself, or the maximum interaction distance, are changed; frequent change of those parameters may render the performance of this method unacceptable. The integral values returned by clippedIntegral() can be useful for computing interaction metrics that are scaled by the amount of “interaction field” (to coin a term) that is present for a given individual, producing metrics of interaction density.  Notably, the localPopulationDensity() method automatically incorporates the mechanics of clippedIntegral() into the calculations it performs; see that method’s documentation for further discussion of this concept.  This approach can also be useful with the interactingNeighborCount() method, provided that the interaction function is of type \"f\" (since the neighbor count does not depend upon interaction strength)."

This method may be used with either spatial or non-spatial interactions, but will be more efficient with spatial interactions that set a short maximum interaction distance.  Draws are done with replacement, so the same individual may be drawn more than once; sometimes using unique() on the result of this call is therefore desirable.  If more than one draw will be needed, it is much more efficient to use a single call to drawByStrength(), rather than drawing individuals one at a time.  Note that if no individuals exert a non-zero interaction strength upon receiver, the vector returned will be zero-length; it is important to consider this possibility.

You must explicitly call evaluate() at an appropriate time in the tick cycle before the interaction is used, but after any relevant changes have been made to the population.  SLiM will invalidate any existing interactions after any portion of the tick cycle in which new individuals have been born or existing individuals have died.  In a WF model, this occurs just before late() events execute (see the WF tick cycle diagram), so late() events are often the appropriate place to put evaluate() calls, but first() or early() events can work too if the interaction is not needed until that point in the tick cycle anyway. In nonWF models, on the other hand, new offspring are produced just before early() events and then individuals die just before late() events (see the nonWF tick cycle diagram), so interactions will be invalidated twice during each tick cycle.  This means that in a nonWF model, an interaction that influences reproduction should usually be evaluated in a first() event, while an interaction that influences fitness or mortality should usually be evaluated in an early() event (and an interaction that affects both may need to be evaluated at both times). If an interaction is never evaluated for a given subpopulation, it is guaranteed that there will be essentially no memory or computational overhead associated with the interaction for that subpopulation.  Furthermore, attempting to query an interaction for a receiver or exerter in a subpopulation that has not been evaluated is guaranteed to raise an error."

Population density is estimated using interaction strengths, effectively doing a kernel density estimate using the interaction function as the kernel.  What is returned is computed as the total interaction strength present at a given point, divided by the integral of the interaction function around that point after clipping by the spatial bounds of the exerter subpopulation (what one might think of as the amount of “interaction field” around the point).  This provides an estimate of local population density, in units of individuals per unit area, as a weighted average over the area covered by the interaction function, where the weight of each exerter in the average is the value of the interaction function at that exerter’s position.  This can also be thought of as a measure of the amount of interaction happening per unit of interaction field in the space surrounding the point. To calculate the clipped integral of the interaction function, this method uses the same numerical estimator used by the clippedIntegral() method of InteractionType, and all of the caveats described for that method apply here also; notably, all individuals must be within spatial bounds, the maximum interaction distance must be less than half the spatial extent of the subpopulation, and interaction() callbacks are not used (and so, for this method, are not allowed to be active).  See the documentation for clippedIntegral() for further discussion of the details of these calculations. To calculate the total interaction strength around the position of a receiver, this method uses the same machinery as the totalOfNeighborStrengths() method of InteractionType, except that – in contrast to other InteractionType methods – the interaction strength exerted by the receiver itself is included in the total (if the exerter subpopulation is the receiver’s own subpopulation).  This is because population density at the location of an individual includes the individual itself.  If this is not desirable, the totalOfNeighborStrengths() method should probably be used. To see the point of this method, consider a receiver located near the edge of the spatial bounds of its subpopulation.  Some portion of the interaction function that surrounds that receiver falls outside the spatial bounds of its subpopulation, and will therefore never contain an interacting exerter.  If, for example, interaction strengths are used as a measure of competition, this receiver will therefore have an advantage, because it will never feel any competition from the portion of its range that falls outside spatial bounds.  However, that portion of its range is presumably also not available to the receiver itself, for foraging or hunting, in which case this advantage is not biologically realistic, but is instead just an undesirable “edge effect” artifact.  Dividing by the integral of the interaction function, clipped to the spatial bounds, provides a way to compensate for this edge effect.  A nice side effect of using local population densities instead of total interaction strengths is that the maximum interaction strength passed to setInteractionFunction() no longer matters; it cancels out when the total interaction strength is divided by the receiver’s clipped integral.  However, the shape of the interaction function does still matter; it determines the relative weights used for exerters at different distances from the position of the receiver."

Beginning in SLiM 4.1, this method has a vectorized mode of operation in which the receiver parameter may be non-singleton.  To switch the method to this mode, pass T for returnDict, rather than the default of F (the operation of which is described above).  In this mode, the return value is a Dictionary object instead of a vector of Individual objects.  This dictionary uses integer keys that range from 0 to N-1, where N is the number of individuals passed in receiver; these keys thus correspond directly to the indices of the individuals in receiver, and there is one entry in the dictionary for each receiver.  The value in the dictionary, for a given integer key, is an object<Individual> vector with the neighbors found for the corresponding receiver, exactly as described above for the non-vectorized case.  The results for each receiver can therefore be obtained from the returned dictionary with getValue(), passing the index of the receiver.  The speed of this mode of operation will probably be similar to the speed of making N separate non-vectorized calls to nearestNeighbors(), when running single-threaded.  When running multi-threaded, however, a substantial performance improvement may be realized by using the vectorized version of this method, since the queries can then be executed in parallel.  In this mode of operation, all receivers must belong to the same subpopulation."

There is a general policy for the remaining arguments: they are NULL by default, and if NULL is used, it specifies “no constraint” for that property (removing any currently existing constraint for that property).  The sex parameter constrains the sex of individuals; it may be \"M\" or “F\" (or \"*\" as another way of specifying no constraint, for historical reasons).  If sex is \"M\" or \"F\", the individuals to which the constraint is applied (potential receivers/exerters) must belong to a sexual species.  The tag parameter constrains the tag property of individuals; if this set, the individuals to which the constraint is applied must have defined tag values.  The minAge and maxAge properties constrain the age property of individuals to the given minimum and/or maximum values; these constraints can only be used in nonWF models.  The migrant property constraints the migrant property of individuals (T constrains to only migrants, F to only non-migrants).  Finally, the tagL0, tagL1, tagL2, tagL3, and tagL4 properties constrain the corresponding logical properties of individuals, requiring them to be either T or F as specified; the individuals to which these constraints are applied must have defined values for the constrained property or properties.  Again, NULL should be supplied (as it is by default) for any property which you do not wish to constrain. These constraints may be used in any combination, as desired.  For example, calling setConstraints(\"receivers\", sex=\"M\", minAge=5, tagL0=T) constrains the interaction type’s operation so that receivers must be males, with an age of at least 5, with a tagL0 property value of T.  For that configuration the potential receivers used with the interaction type must be sexual (since sex is specified), must be in a nonWF model (since minAge is specified), and must have a defined value for their tagL0 property (since that property is constrained).  Note that the sexSegregation parameter to initializeInteractionType() is a shortcut which does the same thing as the corresponding calls to setConstraints(). Exerter constraints are applied at evaluate() time, whereas receiver constraints are applied at query time; see the InteractionType class documentation for further discussion.  The interaction constraints for an interaction type are normally a constant in simulations; in any case, they cannot be changed when an interaction has already been evaluated, so either they should be set prior to evaluation, or unevaluate() should be called first."

If the strengths of interactions exerted by a single individual upon multiple individuals are needed instead (the inverse of what this method provides), multiple calls to this method will be necessary, one per pairwise interaction queried; the interaction engine is not optimized for the inverse case, and so it will likely be quite slow to compute.  If the interaction is reciprocal and has the same receiver and exerter constraints, the opposite query should provide identical results in a single efficient call (because then the interactions exerted are equal to the interactions received); otherwise, the best approach might be to define a second interaction type representing the inverse interaction that you wish to be able to query efficiently."

This method can be useful for narrowing a vector of individuals down to just those that satisfy constraints.  Outside the context of InteractionType, similar functionality is provided by the Subpopulation method subsetIndividuals().  Note that the use of testConstraints() is somewhat rare; usually, queries are evaluated across a vector of individuals, each of which might or might not satisfy the defined constraints.  Individuals that do not satisfy constraints do not participate in interactions, so their interaction strength with other individuals will simply be zero.

For one individual, this is essentially the same as calling nearestInteractingNeighbors() with a large count so as to obtain the complete vector of all interacting neighbors, calling strength() for each of those interactions to get each interaction strength, and adding those interaction strengths together with sum().  This method is much faster than that implementation, however, since all of that work is done as a single operation.  Also, totalOfNeighborStrengths() can total up interactions for more than one receiver in a single vectorized call. Similarly, for one individual this is essentially the same as calling strength() to get the interaction strengths between a receiver and all individuals in the exerter subpopulation, and then calling sum().  Again, this method should be much faster, since this algorithm looks only at neighbors, whereas calling strength() directly assesses interaction strengths with all other individuals.  This will make a particularly large difference when the subpopulation size is large and the maximum distance of the InteractionType is small. See localPopulationDensity() for a related method that calculates the total interaction strength divided by the amount of “interaction field” present for an individual (i.e., the integral of the interaction function clipped to the spatial bounds of the subpopulation) to provide an estimate of the “interaction density” felt by an individual."

In WF models, all interactions are automatically reset to an unevaluated state at the moment when the new offspring generation becomes the parental generation (at step 4 in the tick cycle). In nonWF models, all interactions are automatically reset to an unevaluated state twice per tick: immediately after reproduction() callbacks have completed (after step 1 in the tick cycle), and immediately before viability/survival selection (before step 4 in the tick cycle).

Note that the Subpopulation object itself cannot be passed in context, because class Subpopulation is not under retain-release memory management in SLiM, meaning essentially that subpopulation objects can cease to exist unpredictably (because they go extinct, for example).  A reference to such an object cannot be kept long-term by your script (including by LogFile), because if the object ceases to exist, the reference would become invalid and a crash would result.  Passing such an object – one not under retain-release – to addCustomColumn() will therefore raise an error, to safeguard against that possible crash.  The workaround for this limitation is to find a way to look up the desired object, such as the suggestion above of using the subpopulation’s id to look it up.

The rescaled and clamped values are then colored according to the color scheme named by colors, which should be one of the named schemes supported by the Eidos function colors(): \"cm\", \"heat\", \"terrain\", \"parula\", \"hot\", \"jet\", \"turbo\", \"gray\", \"magma\", \"inferno\", \"plasma\", \"viridis\", or \"cividis\".  If colors is NULL (the default), the color scheme used is the reverse of the \"gray\" color scheme, shading from black for 0 up to white for 1.  In all cases, the color scheme is applied across the range [0, 1] for the rescaled and clamped values. The plotted image will use opacity alpha; alpha values must be in [0.0, 1.0], where 0.0 is fully transparent and 1.0 is fully opaque.  The new image data will be plotted on top of any previously added data.

In WF models this property is T by default, since conversion to Substitution objects provides large speed benefits; it should be set to F only if necessary, and only on the mutation types for which it is necessary.  This might be needed, for example, if you are using a mutationEffect() callback to implement an epistatic relationship between mutations; a mutation epistatically influencing the fitness of other mutations through a mutationEffect() callback would need to continue having that influence even after reaching fixation, but if the simulation were to replace the fixed mutation with a Substitution object the mutation would no longer be considered in fitness calculations (unless the callback explicitly consulted the list of Substitution objects kept by the simulation).  Other script-defined behaviors in mutationEffect(), interaction(), mateChoice(), modifyChild(), and recombination() callbacks might also necessitate the disabling of substitution for a given mutation type; this is an important consideration to keep in mind. In contrast, for nonWF models this property is F by default, because even mutations with no epistatis or other indirect fitness effects will continue to influence the survival probabilities of individuals.  For nonWF models, only neutral mutation types with no epistasis or other side effects can safely be converted to substitutions upon fixation.  When such a pure-neutral mutation type is defined in a nonWF model, this property should be set to T to tell SLiM that substitution is allowed; this may have very large positive effects on performance, so it is important to remember when modeling background neutral mutations. SLiM consults this flag at the end of each tick when deciding whether to substitute each fixed mutation.  If this flag is T, all eligible fixed mutations will be converted at the end of the current tick, even if they were previously left unconverted because of the previous value of the flag.  Setting this flag to F will prevent future substitutions, but will not cause any existing Substitution objects to be converted back into Mutation objects."

Note that the dominance coefficient is not bounded.  A dominance coefficient greater than 1.0 may be used to achieve an overdominance effect.  By making the selection coefficient very small and the dominance coefficient very large, an overdominance scenario in which both homozygotes have the same fitness may be approximated, to a nearly arbitrary degree of precision. Note that this property has a quirk: it is stored internally in SLiM using a single-precision float, not the double-precision float type normally used by Eidos.  This means that if you set a mutation type muttype’s dominance coefficient to some number x, muttype.dominanceCoeff==x may be F due to floating-point rounding error.  Comparisons of floating-point numbers for exact equality is often a bad idea, but this is one case where it may fail unexpectedly.  Instead, it is recommended to use the id or tag properties to identify particular mutation types."

This property is \"s\" by default, indicating that mutations in this stacking group should be allowed to stack without restriction.  If the policy is set to \"f\", the first mutation of stacking group at a given site is retained; further mutations of this stacking group at the same site are discarded with no effect.  This can be useful for modeling one-way changes; once a gene is disabled by a premature stop codon, for example, you might wish to assume, for simplicity, that further mutations cannot alter that fact.  If the policy is set to \"l\", the last mutation of this stacking group at a given site is retained; earlier mutation of this stacking group at the same site are discarded.  This can be useful for modeling an “infinite-alleles” scenario in which every new mutation at a site generates a completely new allele, rather than retaining the previous mutations at the site. The mutation stacking policy applies only within the given mutation type’s stacking group; mutations of different stacking groups are always allowed to stack in SLiM.  The policy applies to all mutations added to the model after the policy is set, whether those mutations are introduced by calls such as addMutation(), addNewMutation(), or addNewDrawnMutation(), or are added by SLiM’s own mutation-generation machinery.  However, no attempt is made to enforce the policy for mutations already existing at the time the policy is set; typically, therefore, the policy is set in an initialize() callback so that it applies throughout the simulation.  The policy is also not enforced upon the mutations loaded from a file with readFromPopulationFile(); such mutations were governed by whatever stacking policy was in effect when the population file was generated. In nucleotide-based models, the stacking policy for nucleotide-based mutation types is always \"l\", and cannot be changed.  This ensures that new nucleotide mutations always replace the previous nucleotide at a site, and that more than one nucleotide mutation is never present at the same position in a single haplosome."

The spatiality of the map: the subset of the model’s dimensions that are used by the spatial map.  The spatiality of a map is configured by defineSpatialMap() and cannot subsequently be changed.  For example, a 3D model (with dimensionality \"xyz\") might define a 2D spatial map with spatiality \"xz\", providing spatial values that do not depend upon the \"y\" dimension.  Often, however, the spatiality of a map will match the dimensionality of the model.

For a 1D spatial map, factor-1 new values will be inserted between every pair of values in the original value grid.  A factor of 2 would therefore insert one new value between each pair of existing values, thereby increasing the map’s resolution by a factor of two.  Note that if the spatial map’s original grid dimension was N, the new grid dimension with a factor of k would be k(N−1)+1, not kN, because new values are inserted only between existing values.  For 2D and 3D spatial maps, essentially the same process is conducted along each axis of the map’s spatiality, increasing the resolution of the map by factor in every dimension. If method is \"linear\" (the default), linear (or bilinear or trilinear, for 2D/3D maps) interpolation will be used to interpolate the values for the new grid points.  Alternatively, if method is \"nearest\", the nearest value in the old grid will be used for new grid points; with this method, it is recommended that factor be odd, not even, to avoid artifacts due to rounding of coordinates midway between the original grid positions.  If method is \"cubic\", cubic (or bicubic, for 2D maps) will be used; this generally produces smoother interpolation with fewer artifacts than \"linear\", but it is not supported for 3D maps.  The choice of interpolation method used here is independent of the map’s interpolate property.  Note that while the \"nearest\" and \"linear\" interpolation methods will leave the range of values in the map unchanged, \"cubic\" interpolation may produce interpolated values that are outside the original range of values (by design).  Periodic boundaries are currently supported only for \"nearest\", \"linear\", and 1D \"cubic\" interpolation."

The sampling of the spatial map can be done in one of two ways, as controlled by the centers parameter.  If centers is T, a (width+1) × (height+1) grid of lines that delineates width × height rectangular pixels will be overlaid on top of the spatial map, and values will be sampled from the spatial map at the center of each of these pixels.  If centers is F (the default), a width × height grid of lines will be overlaid on top of the spatial map, and values will be sampled from the spatial map at the vertices of the grid.  If interpolation is not enabled for the spatial map, these two options will both recover the original matrix of values used to define the spatial map (assuming, here and below, that width and height are NULL).  If interpolation is enabled for the spatial map, however, centers == F will recover the original values, but will not capture the “typical” value of each pixel in the image; centers == T, on the other hand, will not recover the original values, but will capture the “typical” value of each pixel in the image (i.e., the value at the center of each pixel, as produced by interpolation). If color is T (the default), the valueRange and colors parameters supplied to defineSpatialMap() will be used to translate map values to RGB color values as described in the documentation of that method, providing the same appearance as in SLiMgui; of course those parameters must have been supplied, otherwise an error will result.  If color is F, on the other hand, a grayscale image will be produced that directly reflects the map values without color translation.  In this case, this method needs to translate map values, which can have any float value, into grayscale pixel values that are integers in [0, 255].  To do so, the map values are multiplied by 255.0, clamped to [0.0, 255.0], and then rounded to the nearest integer.  This translation scheme essentially assumes that map values are in [0, 1]; for spatial maps that were defined using the floatK channel of a grayscale PNG image, this should recover the original image’s pixel values.  (If a different translation scheme is desired, color=T with the desired valueRange and colors should be used.)"

The kernel specification is similar to that for the setInteractionType() method of InteractionType, but omits the maximum value of the kernel.  Specifically, functionType may be \"f\", in which case no ellipsis arguments should be supplied; \"l\", similarly with no ellipsis arguments; \"e\", in which case the ellipsis should supply a numeric$ lambda (rate) parameter for a negative exponential function; \"n\", in which case the ellipsis should supply a numeric$ sigma (standard deviation) parameter for a Gaussian function; \"c\", in which case the ellipsis should supply a numeric$ scale parameter for a Cauchy distribution function; or \"t\", in which case the ellipsis should supply a numeric$ degrees of freedom and a numeric$ scale parameter for a t-distribution function.  See the InteractionType class documentation for discussions of these kernel types. Distance metrics specified to this method, such as maxDistance and the additional kernel shape parameters, are measured in the distance scale of the spatial map – the same distance scale in which the spatial bounds of the map are specified.  The operation is performed upon the grid values of the spatial map; distances are internally translated into the scale of the value grid.  For non-periodic boundaries, clipping at the edge of the spatial map is done; in a 2D map with no periodic boundaries, for example, the weights of edge and corner grid values are adjusted for their partial (one-half and one-quarter) coverage.  For periodic boundaries, the smoothing operation will automatically wrap around based upon the assumption that the grid values at the two connected edges of the periodic boundary have identical values (which they should, since by definition they represent the same position in space). The density scale of the kernel has no effect and will be normalized; this is the reason that smooth(), unlike InteractionType, does not require specification of the maximum value of the kernel.  This normalization prevents the kernel from increasing or decreasing the average spatial map value (apart from possible edge effects)."

When passed the resulting pattern dictionary, the addMultiRecombinant() method will produce the first offspring haplosome using the Haplosome objects strand1 and strand2 with the vector of recombination breakpoints breaks1, and likewise will produce the second offspring haplosome using strand3, strand4, and breaks2.  If both parental strands for an offspring haplosome are NULL, the breaks vector must be NULL or empty, and a null haplosome will be produced.  If the first parental strand is non-NULL and the second is NULL for an offspring haplosome, the breaks vector must again be NULL or empty, and the first strand will be cloned with mutation.  If both parental strands for an offspring haplosome are non-NULL, recombination between the strands will be done using the supplied breaks vector; in this case, if the breaks vector is NULL then addMultiRecombinant() will automatically generate breakpoints for the recombination.  All of these semantics are discussed further in the documentation for addMultiRecombinant(); this method is just a helper for that method.  The documentation for addRecombinant() may also be helpful for understanding the concepts here, since it is the conceptual foundation upon which the very complex architecture of the addMultiRecombinant() method is built. Unlike addPatternForClone() and addPatternForCrossed(), which must infer the inheritance pattern given the chromosome type and the offspring sex, addPatternForRecombinant() is given the inheritance pattern, and must simply confirm that it is valid.  If sex is NULL (the default), this validation only needs to check that the inheritance pattern is possible, for some sex.  For example, if the chromosome type is \"X\" then the inheritance pattern must produce a non-null first haplosome, and the second haplosome can be null (for a male, X–) or non-null (for a female, XX); other inheritance patterns would fail validation.  When the sex is known, \"M\" or \"F\" may optionally be passed to validate against that sex; X– would then fail validation if a female is specified, for example.  In non-sexual models, NULL must be passed.  Note that the generated inheritance dictionary does not encode the offspring sex; the sex parameter is simply used for validation.  The final pattern dictionary passed to addMultiRecombinant() will be validated against the sex parameter given to that method. The randomizeStrands parameter indicates whether or not the order of recombining parental strands should be randomized in the inheritance dictionary.  If randomizeStrands is T, then if strand1 and strand2 are both non-NULL, their order will be randomized; and similarly for strand3 and strand4.  If randomizeStrands is F, no randomization will be done in the inheritance dictionary – but strand order randomization may still be done by addMultiRecombinant() if T is passed for its own randomizeStrands parameter.  Randomizing the strand order is usually desirable, to avoid an inheritance bias due to a lack of randomization in the initial copy strand.  Whether you wish to randomize strand order in addPatternForRecombinant() or in addMultiRecombinant() is up to you; it is harmless to do it in both places, apart from a small performance penalty, but there is no benefit. Of the family of addPatternFor...() methods, addPatternForRecombinant() is the most commonly used.  Typically, addMultiRecombinant() can automatically infer the correct inheritance pattern for crossing or cloning (as described in its documentation), but for more complex inheritance patterns, using addPatternForRecombinant() is necessary (unless you want to build the pattern dictionary yourself)."

Beginning with SLiM 3.0, the ages parameter may be used to control the output of the ages of individuals in nonWF simulations.  If ages is F, the output will not contain ages, preserving backward compatibility with the output format of SLiM 2.1 and later.  If ages is T, ages will be output for nonWF models.  In WF simulations, the ages parameter will be ignored. Beginning with SLiM 3.3, the ancestralNucleotides parameter may be used to control the output of the ancestral nucleotide sequence in nucleotide-based models.  If ancestralNucleotides is F, the output will not contain ancestral nucleotide information, and so the ancestral sequence will not be restored correctly if the saved file is loaded with readPopulationFile().  This option is provided because the ancestral sequence may be quite large, for models with a long chromosome (e.g., 1 GB if the chromosome is 109 bases long, when saved in text format, or 0.25 GB when saved in binary format).  If the model is not nucleotide-based (as enabled with the nucleotideBased parameter to initializeSLiMOptions()), the ancestralNucleotides parameter will be ignored.  Note that in nucleotide-based models the output format will always include the nucleotides associated with any nucleotide-based mutations; the ancestralNucleotides flag governs only the ancestral sequence. Beginning with SLiM 3.5, the pedigreeIDs parameter may be used to request that pedigree IDs be written out (and read in by readFromPopulationFile(), subsequently).  This option is turned off (F) by default, for brevity.  This option may only be used if SLiM’s optional pedigree tracking has been enabled with initializeSLiMOptions(keepPedigrees=T). Beginning with SLiM 5.0, the objectTags parameter may be used to request that tag values for objects be written out.  This option is turned off (F) by default, for brevity; if it turned on (T), the values of all tags for all objects of supported classes (Chromosome, Subpopulation, Individual, Haplosome, Mutation, Substitution) will be written.  For individuals, the tag, tagF, tagL0, tagL1, tagL2, tagL3, and tagL4 properties will be written; for chromosomes, subpopulations, haplosomes, and mutations, the tag property will be written.  The saved tag information can be read in by readFromPopulationFile(), but only if the output is in binary format (binary=T).  Note that if there is other state that you wish you persist, such as tags on objects of other classes, values attached to objects with setValue(), and so forth, you should persist that state in separate files using calls such as writeFile(). Beginning with SLiM 5.0, the substitutions parameter may be used to request that information about Substitution objects in the simulation be written out.  This option is turned off (F) by default, for brevity.  The saved substitution information can be read in by readFromPopulationFile(), but only if the output is in binary format (binary=T). Output is generally done in a late() event, so that the output reflects the state of the simulation at the end of a tick."

In SLiM 2.3 and later when using the WF model, calling readFromPopulationFile() from any context other than a late() event causes a warning; calling from a late() event is almost always correct in WF models, so that fitness values can be automatically recalculated by SLiM at the usual time in the tick cycle without the need to force their recalculation (see comments on recalculateFitness()). In SLiM 3.0 when using the nonWF model, calling readFromPopulationFile() from any context other than an early() event causes a warning; calling from an early() event is almost always correct in nonWF models, so that fitness values can be automatically recalculated by SLiM at the usual time in the tick cycle without the need to force their recalculation (see comments on recalculateFitness()). This method changes the tick and cycle counters to the tick and cycle read from the file.  If you do not want these counters to be changed, you can change them back after reading, by setting community.tick and sim.cycle to whatever values you wish.  Note that restoring a saved past state and running forward again will not yield the same simulation results, because the random number generator’s state will not be the same; if you wish to ensure reproducibility from a given time point, setSeed() can be used to establish a new seed value. Any changes made to the structure of the species (mutation types, genomic element types, etc.) will not be wiped and re-established by readFromPopulationFile(); this method loads only the population’s state, not the species configuration, so care should be taken to ensure that the species structure meshes coherently with the loaded data.  Indeed, state such as the selfing and cloning rates of subpopulations, and values set onto objects with setValue(), will also be lost, since it is not saved out by outputFull().  Only information saved by outputFull() will be restored; all other state associated with the mutations, haplosomes, individuals, and subpopulations in the simulation will be lost, and should be re-established by the model if it is still needed.  Note that some state is saved by outputFull() only optionally, such as the tag values of individuals; if a given option is enabled and the corresponding information is saved, then that information will be restored, otherwise it will not be. As of SLiM 2.3, this method will read and restore the spatial positions of individuals if that information is present in the output file and the species has enabled continuous space.  If spatial positions are present in the output file but the species has not enabled continuous space (or the number of spatial dimensions does not match), an error will result.  If the species has enabled continuous space but spatial positions are not present in the output file, the spatial positions of the individuals read will be undefined, but an error is not raised. As of SLiM 3.0, this method will read and restore the ages of individuals if that information is present in the output file and the simulation is based upon the nonWF model.  If ages are present but the simulation uses a WF model, an error will result; the WF model does not use age information.  If ages are not present but the simulation uses a nonWF model, an error will also result; the nonWF model requires age information. As of SLiM 3.3, this method will restore the nucleotides of nucleotide-based mutations, and will restore the ancestral nucleotide sequence, if that information is present in the output file.  Loading an output file that contains nucleotide information in a non-nucleotide-based model, and vice versa, will produce an error. As of SLiM 3.5, this method will read and restore the pedigree IDs of individuals and haplosomes if that information is present in the output file (as requested with outputFull(pedigreeIDs=T)) and if SLiM’s optional pedigree tracking has been enabled with initializeSLiMOptions(keepPedigrees=T). As of SLiM 5.0, this method will read and restore tag values for objects of supported classes (Chromosome, Subpopulation, Individual, Haplosome, Mutation, Substitution) if they were saved by outputFull() with its objectTags=T option.  This facility is only available when reading binary output from outputFull(), as chosen by its binary=T option; otherwise, an error will result. As of SLiM 5.0, this method will read and restore substitutions if they were saved by outputFull() with its substitutions=T option.  This facility is only available when reading binary output from outputFull(), as chosen by its binary=T option; otherwise, an error will result. This method can also be used to read tree-sequence information, in the form of single-chromosome .trees files and multi-chromosome trees archives, as saved by treeSeqOutput() or generated by the Python pyslim package.  Note that the user metadata for a tree-sequence file can be read separately with the treeSeqMetadata() function.  Beginning with SLiM 4, the subpopMap parameter may be supplied to re-order the populations of the input tree sequence when it is loaded in to SLiM.  This parameter must have a value that is a Dictionary; the keys of this dictionary should be SLiM population identifiers as string values (e.g., \"p2\"), and the values should be indexes of populations in the input tree sequence; a key/value pair of \"p2\", 4 would mean that the fifth population in the input (the one at zero-based index 4) should become p2 on loading into SLiM.  If subpopMap is non-NULL, all populations in the tree sequence must be explicitly mapped, even if their index will not change and even if they will not be used by SLiM; the only exception is for unused slots in the population table, which can be explicitly remapped but do not have to be.  For instance, suppose we have a tree sequence in which population 0 is unused, population 1 is not a SLiM population (for example, an ancestral population produced by msprime), and population 2 is a SLiM population, and we want to load this in with population 2 as p0 in SLiM.  To do this, we could supply a value of Dictionary(\"p0\", 2, \"p1\", 1, \"p2\", 0) for subpopMap, or we could leave out slot 0 since it is unused, with Dictionary(\"p0\", 2, \"p1\", 1).  Although this facility cannot be used to remove populations in the tree sequence, note that it may add populations that will be visible when treeSeqOutput() is called (although these will not be SLiM populations); if, in this example, we had used Dictionary(\"p0\", 0, \"p1\", 1, \"p5\", 2) and then we wrote the result out with treeSeqOutput(), the resulting tree sequence would have six populations, although three of them would be empty and would not be used by SLiM.  The use of subpopMap makes it easier to load simulation data that was generated in Python, since that typically uses an id of 0.  The subpopMap parameter may not be used with file formats other than tree-sequence files, at the present time; setting up the correct subpopulation ids is typically easier when working with those other formats.  Note the tskit command-line interface can be used, like python3 -m tskit populations file.trees, to find out the number of subpopulations in a tree-sequence file and their IDs. When loading a tree sequence, a crosscheck of the loaded data will be performed to ensure that the tree sequence was well-formed and was loaded correctly.  When running a Release build of SLiM, however, this crosscheck will only occur the first time that readFromPopulationFile() is called to load a tree sequence; subsequent calls will not perform this crosscheck, for greater speed when running models that load saved population state many times (such as models that are conditional on fixation).  If you suspect that a tree sequence file might be corrupted, or might be read incorrectly, running a Debug build of SLiM enables crosschecks after every load."

The optional parameter tick provides the tick for which mutationEffect() and fitnessEffect() callbacks should be selected; if it is NULL (the default), the current tick value for the simulation, community.tick, is used.  If you call recalculateFitness() in an early() event in a WF model, you may wish this to be community.tick - 1 in order to utilize the mutationEffect() and fitnessEffect() callbacks for the previous tick, as if the changes that you have made to fitness-influencing parameters were already in effect at the end of the previous tick when the new generation was first created and evaluated (usually it is simpler to just make such changes in a late() event instead, however, in which case calling recalculateFitness() is probably not necessary at all since fitness values will be recalculated immediately afterwards).  Regardless of the value supplied for tick here, community.tick inside callbacks will report the true tick number, so if your callbacks consult that parameter in order to create tick-specific fitness effects you will need to handle the discrepancy somehow.  (Similar considerations apply for nonWF models that call recalculateFitness() in a late() event, which is also not advisable in general.) After this call, the fitness values used for all purposes in SLiM will be the newly calculated values.  Calling this method will trigger the calling of any enabled and applicable mutationEffect() and fitnessEffect() callbacks, so this is quite a heavyweight operation; you should think carefully about what side effects might result (which is why fitness recalculation does not just occur automatically after changes that might affect fitness values)."

This method may only be called if tree sequence recording has been turned on with initializeTreeSeq(); in addition, checkCoalescence=T must have been supplied to initializeTreeSeq(), so that the necessary work is done during each tree-sequence simplification.  Since this method does not perform coalescence checking itself, but instead simply returns the coalescence state observed at the last simplification, it may be desirable to call treeSeqSimplify() immediately before treeSeqCoalesced() to obtain up-to-date information.  However, the speed penalty of doing this in every tick would be large, and most models do not need this level of precision; usually it is sufficient to know that the model has coalesced, without knowing whether that happened in the current tick or in a recent preceding tick."

In a model of a single chromosome, a binary tree sequence file will be written to the specified path; a filename extension of .trees is suggested for this type of file, and such a file is often referred to as a “.trees file”.  In a multi-chromosome model, a directory will instead be created at the specified path, and a separate .trees file will be created within that directory for each chromosome in the model, mirroring the fact that SLiM keeps a separate tree sequence for each chromosome in a multi-chromosome model.  These .trees files will be given filenames based upon the symbol property of each chromosome, as provided to initializeChromosome(); for example, the tree sequence for a chromosome with symbol \"X\" will be saved as chromosome_X.trees within the specified directory.  For the name of the directory itself, a suffix of _trees is suggested, rather than .trees, since the use of dot-extensions in directory names is not common; for example, \"model_Q_seed_17_trees\" would be a path you might pass to treeSeqOutput() as a directory name in a multi-chromosome model.  Such a directory, containing separate .trees files for each chromosome, is called a “trees archive”.  Both .trees files and trees archives can be read by readFromPopulationFile(), as discussed in its documentation. Normally, the full SLiM script used to generate the tree sequence is written out to the provenance entry of the tree sequence file, to the model subkey of the parameters top-level key.  Supplying F for includeModel suppresses output of the full script. A Dictionary object containing user-generated metadata may be supplied with the metadata parameter.  If present, this dictionary will be serialized as JSON and attached to the saved tree sequence under a key named user_metadata, within the SLiM key.  If tskit is used to read the tree sequence in Python, this metadata will automatically be deserialized and made available at ts.metadata[\"SLiM\"][\"user_metadata\"].  This metadata dictionary is not used by SLiM, or by pyslim, tskit, or msprime; you may use it for any purpose you wish.  Note that metadata may actually be any subclass of Dictionary, such as a DataFrame.  It can even be a Species object such as sim, or a LogFile instance; however, only the keys and values contained by the object’s Dictionary superclass state will be serialized into the metadata (properties of the subclass will be ignored).  This metadata dictionary can be recovered from the saved file using the treeSeqMetadata() function. When saving a single .trees file, the standard behavior is to overwrite an existing file of the same name; the convenience of this generally outweighs the danger.  When saving a trees archive, however, that balance shifts; overwriting an entire directory is potentially quite dangerous.  For this reason, overwriteDirectory=F (the default) specifies that treeSeqOutput() should not overwrite an existing directory; it will instead raise an error.  If overwriteDirectory is T, treeSeqOutput() will overwrite an existing directory of the same name (if the existing directory can be deleted without permissions errors and so forth), but only if the existing directory is empty or contains only files with a .trees suffix, for safety; if other files are present, an error will still be raised."

There are two ways to keep individuals across simplification.  If permanent is T (the default), then the specified individuals will be permanently remembered: their haplosomes will be added to the current sample, and they will always be present in the tree sequence.  Permanently remembering a large number of individuals will, of course, markedly increase memory usage and runtime. Supplying F for permanent will instead mark the individuals only for (temporary) retention: their haplosomes will not be added to the sample, and they will appear in the final tree sequence only if one of their haplosomes is retained across simplification.  In other words, the rule of thumb for retained individuals is simple: if a haplosome is kept by simplification, the haplosome’s corresponding individual is kept also, if it is retained.  Note that permanent remembering takes priority; calling this function with permanent=F on an individual that has previously been permanently remembered will not remove it from the sample. The behavior of simplification for individuals retained with permanent=F depends upon the value of the retainCoalescentOnly flag passed to initializeTreeSeq(); here we will discuss the behavior of that flag in detail.  First of all, haplosomes are always removed by simplification unless they are (a) part of the final generation (i.e., in a living individual when simplification occurs), (b) ancestral to the final generation, (c) a haplosome of a permanently remembered individual, or (d) ancestral to a permanently remembered individual.  If retainCoalescentOnly is T (the default), they are also always removed if they are not a branch point (i.e., a coalescent node or most recent common ancestor) in the tree sequence.  In some cases it may be useful to retain a haplosome and its associated individual when it is simply an intermediate node in the ancestry (i.e., in the middle of a branch).  This can be enabled by setting retainCoalescentOnly to F in your call to initializeTreeSeq().  In this case, ancestral haplosomes that are intermediate (“unary nodes”, in tskit parlance) and are within an individual that has been retained using the permanent=F flag here are kept, along with the retained individual itself.  Since setting retainCoalescentOnly to F will prevent the unary nodes for retained individuals from being pruned, simplification may often be unable to prune very much at all from the tree sequence, and memory usage and runtime may increase rapidly.  If you are retaining many individuals, this setting should therefore be used only with caution; it is not necessary if you are purely interested in the most recent common ancestors.  See the pyslim documentation for further discussion of retaining and remembering individuals and the effects of the retainCoalescentOnly flag. The metadata (age, location, etc) that are stored in the resulting tree sequence are those values present at either (a) the final generation, if the individual is alive when the tree sequence is output, or (b) the last time that the individual was remembered, if not.  Calling treeSeqRememberIndividuals() on an individual that is already remembered will cause the archived information about the remembered individual to be updated to reflect the individual’s current state.  A case where this is particularly important is for the spatial location of individuals in continuous-space models.  SLiM automatically remembers the individuals that comprise the first generation of any new subpopulation created with addSubpop(), for easy recapitation and other analysis.  However, since these first-generation individuals are remembered at the moment they are created, their spatial locations have not yet been set up, and will contain garbage – and those garbage values will be archived in their remembered state.  If you need correct spatial locations of first-generation individuals for your post-simulation analysis, you should call treeSeqRememberIndividuals() explicitly on the first generation, after setting spatial locations, to update the archived information with the correct spatial positions."

The new offspring individual is generated from parent1 and parent2 by crossing them.  In sexual models parent1 must be female and parent2 must be male; in hermaphroditic models, parent1 and parent2 are unrestricted.  If parent1 and parent2 are the same individual in a hermaphroditic model, that parent self-fertilizes, or “selfs”, to generate the offspring sexually (note this is not the same as clonal reproduction).  Such selfing is considered “incidental” by addCrossed(), however; if the preventIncidentalSelfing flag of initializeSLiMOptions() is T, supplying the same individual for parent1 and parent2 is an error (you must check for and prevent incidental selfing if you set that flag in a nonWF model).  If non-incidental selfing is desired, addSelfed() should be used instead. The sex parameter specifies the sex of the offspring.  A value of NULL means “make the default choice”; in non-sexual models it is the only legal value for sex, and does nothing, whereas in sexual models it causes male or female to be chosen with equal probability.  A value of \"M\" or \"F\" for sex specifies that the offspring should be male or female, respectively.  Finally, a float value from 0.0 to 1.0 for sex provides the probability that the offspring will be male; a value of 0.0 will produce a female, a value of 1.0 will produce a male, and for intermediate values SLiM will draw the sex of the offspring randomly according to the specified probability.  Unless you wish the bias the sex ratio of offspring, the default value of NULL should generally be used. Note that any defined, active, and applicable recombination(), mutation(), and modifyChild() callbacks will be called as a side effect of calling this method, before this method even returns.  For recombination() and mutation() callbacks, the subpopulation of the parent that is generating a given gamete is used; for modifyChild() callbacks the situation is more complex.  In most biparental mating events, parent1 and parent2 will belong to the same subpopulation, and modifyChild() callbacks for that subpopulation will be used, just as in WF models.  In certain models (such as models of pollen flow and broadcast spawning), however, biparental mating may occur between parents that are not from the same subpopulation; that is legal in nonWF models, and in that case, modifyChild() callbacks for the subpopulation of parent1 are used (since that is the maternal parent). If the modifyChild() callback process results in rejection of the proposed child, a new offspring individual is not generated.  To force the generation of an offspring individual from a given pair of parents, you could loop until addCrossed() succeeds, but note that if your modifyChild() callback rejects all proposed children from those particular parents, your model will then hang, so care must be taken with this approach.  Usually, nonWF models do not force generation of offspring in this manner; rejection of a proposed offspring by a modifyChild() callback typically represents a phenomenon such as post-mating reproductive isolation or lethal genetic incompatibilities that would reduce the expected litter size, so the default behavior is typically desirable. Beginning in SLiM 4.1, the count parameter dictates how many offspring will be generated (previously, exactly one offspring was generated).  Each offspring is generated independently, based upon the given parameters.  The returned vector contains all generated offspring, except those that were rejected by a modifyChild() callback.  If all offspring are rejected, object<Individual>(0) is returned, which is a zero-length object vector of class Individual; note that this is a change in behavior from earlier versions, which would return NULL.

For all chromosome types except \"A\", null haplosomes will be generated as dictated by the sex of the individual and type of the chromosome.  For example, for chromosome type \"X\" a female would be generated with two empty haplosomes for that chromosome (XX), whereas a male would be generated with one empty haplosome and one null haplosome (X–, in SLiM parlance).  For chromosome type \"H\" an empty haplosome is always generated, not a null haplosome.  But for chromosome type \"A\", in particular, more control is afforded.  Passing NULL (the default) or F for haplosome1Null will make the first haplosome for every chromosome of type \"A\" be a non-null (empty) haplosome, the standard behavior.  More interestingly, passing T for haplosome1Null would make the first haplosome for every chromosome of type \"A\" be a null haplosome.  Similarly, passing T for haplosome2Null would make the second haplosome for every chromosome of type \"A\" be a null haplosome.  This option could be useful for situations such as adding new haploids into a haplodiploid model.  (Separate control over the haploid or diploid configuration of each chromosome of type \"A\" is not presently supported, but would be a simple extension to the design, by allowing haplosome1Null and haplosome2Null to provide a whole vector of logical flags rather than just a singleton value; please request this feature if you require it.)

                "description": " Generates a new offspring individual based upon the inheritance pattern specified by pattern, queues it for addition to the target subpopulation, and returns it.  The new offspring will not be visible as a member of the target subpopulation until the end of the offspring generation tick cycle stage.  The “pattern dictionary” supplied in pattern must be of class Dictionary (or a subclass of Dictionary), and more particularly, must be a dictionary of dictionaries structured in a specific way as described below.  This method is a multi-chromosome version of the addRecombinant() method.  For single-chromosome models, using addRecombinant() will be simpler; and it will be easier to understand this extremely complex method if you understand addRecombinant() first. The top-level “pattern dictionary” given by pattern specifies the way in which each chromosome should be handled.  It can use integer keys, in which case each key is the id of a chromosome, or string keys, in which case each key is the symbol of a chromosome.  In either case, a chromosome’s inheritance pattern is specified by an “inheritance dictionary” in pattern attached to such a chromosome id or symbol key.  That inheritance dictionary should itself contain up to six keys, with the standard names \"strand1\", \"strand2\", \"breaks1\", \"strand3\", \"strand4\", and \"breaks2\".  Any key which is missing in an inheritance dictionary is assumed to have a value of NULL, and missing keys will be referred to having a value of NULL here for simplicity.  These key-value pairs are used in precisely the same way as the parameters of the same names for addRecombinant(), to produce the offspring haplosome(s) for each specified chromosome.  There is some complication regarding how these six values can be used to produce results like crossing, cloning, and selfing, involving as many as four different “parents” for each chromosome; rather than repeating all of that documentation here, please see the addRecombinant() documentation for more information.  When an inheritance dictionary is supplied for a particular chromosome, this method uses the six values that dictionary contains (strand1, strand2, breaks1, strand3, strand4, breaks2) in exactly the same way as addRecombinant() does; addMultiRecombinant() simply supports multiple chromosomes.  In addition to that, however, addMultiRecombinant() also allows the pattern dictionary to omit the inheritance dictionaries for particular chromosomes; the behavior of addMultiRecombinant() in that special case will be described below, after discussing all other aspects of the method’s implementation. The sex parameter optionally specifies the sex of the offspring.  The default value of NULL for sex specifies “default behavior”; in a non-sexual model this is the only legal value, and produces a hermaphroditic offspring.  In a sexual model, the “default behavior” of NULL is that the offspring’s sex is dictated by the haplosome structure it inherits.  For example, if pattern specifies that the offspring will have two non-null haplosomes for a chromosome of type \"X\", the sex of the offspring must therefore be female, whereas if it will have one non-null \"X\" haplosome and one null \"X\" haplosome, it must therefore be male.  SLiM will scan through pattern to determine such constraints and enforce them.  If the constraints implied by pattern are not self-consistent (if the offspring would have two non-null \"X\" haplosomes but also a non-null \"Y\" haplosome, for example), an error will be raised.  The constraints defined by each chromosome type, as described in initializeChromosome(), must always be followed, even when using addMultiRecombinant().  If sex is NULL and pattern imposes no constraints upon the sex of the offspring, the offspring will be chosen as male or female with equal probability.  A value of \"M\" or \"F\" for sex specifies that the offspring should be male or female, respectively.  A float value from 0.0 to 1.0 for sex provides the probability that the offspring will be male; a value of 0.0 will produce a female, a value of 1.0 will produce a male, and for intermediate values SLiM will draw the sex of the offspring randomly according to the specified probability.  In these cases where sex is not NULL, SLiM will first determine the sex of the individual as just described, and will then scan through pattern to confirm that it is compatible with the sex that was determined.  Again, if there is a conflict an error will be raised; you cannot specify the sex of an individual to be incompatible with the haplosomes that it inherits, and if you specify a sex with a string or float value it is up to you to ensure that that is compatible with the specifications in pattern.  (If you need more flexibility, you should probably not use a sexual model at all, but simply use chromosome types \"A\" and \"H\" in a non-sexual model, track the sex of individuals yourself with a tag value such as tagL0, and manipulate haplosomes during reproduction however you wish; SLiM then imposes no constraints.) By default, the offspring is considered to have no parents, since there may be more than two “parents” in the general case.  If specifying parentage is desired, parent1 and/or parent2 may be passed explicitly; this will establish those individuals as the parents of the offspring for purposes of pedigree tracking, and for several other purposes described below.  If only one of parent1 and parent2 is non-NULL, that individual will be set as both of the parents of the offspring, mirroring the way that parentage is tracked for other cases such as addCloned() and addSelfed().  It is not required for parent1 or parent2 to actually be a genetic parent of the offspring at all, although typically they would be.  To benefit from the full functionality of addMultiRecombinant() as described below, it is best to supply parent1 and parent2 when possible. The randomizeStrands parameter is used to control the recombination behavior of addMultiRecombinant().  An inheritance dictionary can specify two parental strands with crossover breakpoints between them to generate one offspring strand with recombination – for example, with the \"strand1\", \"strand2\", and \"breaks1\" keys, as described above, but the same is true of the \"strand3\", \"strand4\", and \"breaks2\" keys, and the discussion that follows applies to both cases.  If randomizeStrands is F, the supplied strands are used as given; for example, \"strand1\" will be the initial copy strand when generating the first gamete to form the offspring.  This mode should be used if you want explicit control over the initial copy strand; one example would be if your script is explicitly generating all four of the products of a meiosis event.  If randomizeStrands is T, then if \"strand1\" and \"strand2\" are both non-NULL, 50% of the time they will be swapped, making \"strand2\" the initial copy strand for the first gamete instead.  This mode (randomizeStrands=T) is usually the desired behavior, to avoid an inheritance bias due to a lack of randomization in the initial copy strand, so passing T for randomizeStrands is recommended unless you specifically desire otherwise.  The default value of randomizeStrands is NULL in order to force either T or F to be explicitly chosen whenever it would make a difference; if it is left as NULL, an error will be raised if generation of the specified offspring involves recombination, since then SLiM needs to know whether the value is T or F.  (This unconventional approach has been adopted because the default value was F prior to SLiM 5, but T is almost always the correct behavior, as explained above.  To try to prevent accidental bugs, this new policy was adopted to force the user to explicitly choose T or F whenever it matters.) The value of the meanParentAge property of the generated offspring is calculated from the mean parent age of each of its two haplosomes (whether they turn out to be null haplosomes or not).  The addRecombinant() documentation provides a simple example; for addMultiRecombinant() the logic is the same, but potentially extended to more than two offspring haplosomes. Callbacks can be involved in offspring generation with addMultiRecombinant(), but because there are up to four strands with up to four different parents, things are a bit complicated and different from other add...() methods; the policy described here seems like the best compromise.  The target subpopulation for the addMultiRecombinant() call will be used to locate applicable mutation() and modifyChild() callbacks governing the generation of the offspring individual.  On the other hand, recombination() callbacks will be found based upon the subpopulations to which parent1 and parent2 belong (for reasons discussed further in drawBreakpoints()); if a parent individual is not supplied, recombination() callbacks will not be called at all when generating the corresponding offspring haplosome. When breakpoints are explicitly supplied to addMultiRecombinant() with breaks1 or breaks2, gene conversion tracts are not well-supported by this method; the breaks1 and breaks2 vectors provide simple crossover breakpoints, which may be used to implement crossovers or simple gene conversion tracts, but complex gene conversion tracts with heteroduplex mismatch repair are not supported in this mode of operation since there is no way to supply the relevant information.  If, on the other hand, breaks1 or breaks2 is NULL when generating a haplosome with recombination, then as described above, addRecombinant() will generate breakpoints internally for that cross, and in this case, complex gene conversion tracts with heteroduplex mismatch repair are supported, since all of the necessary information is available.  Similarly, if the inheritance dictionary for a given chromosome is omitted from pattern entirely and a cross between parent1 and parent2 is inferred (as discussed below), the recombination algorithm used will support gene conversion including heteroduplex mismatch repair. Finally, count is the number of offspring to generate using the given pattern and parameters, and defer is used for deferral of offspring generation, as described for addRecombinant().  Any other details omitted from this documentation are all as described for addRecombinant(). Constructing a well-formed pattern dictionary with inheritance dictionaries for every chromosome can be a bit complex and require many lines of code.  To ease the process, see the Species methods addPatternForCross(), addPatternForClone(), addPatternForNull(), and addPatternForRecombinant(), which help you to build a pattern dictionary one inheritance dictionary at a time.  However, several of these methods will probably be used infrequently, because of the final aspect of addMultiRecombinant() that we have not yet properly discussed. As mentioned earlier, not all chromosomes need to be specified with an inheritance dictionary in pattern; whenever SLiM’s default inheritance behavior is well-defined and is desired for a given chromosome, the inheritance dictionary for that chromosome may be omitted, and will be inferred by addMultiRecombinant() automatically.  This behavior makes it easy to specify a reproduction event that is, for example, like a regular biparental cross involving many chromosomes, but that uses a different reproductive pattern just for one particular chromosome that behaves in a special way.  The inferred inheritance dictionary for a given chromosome is based upon the chromosome type, the values of parent1 and parent2, and the sex of the offspring (which has, by this point, been determined in all cases).  The rules for this inference are actually quite simple.  If both parents are specified (that is, are both non-NULL), the inferred inheritance dictionary is the same as would be produced by a call to addPatternForCross() with those two parents, given in that order, for that chromosome, for the determined offspring sex.  If only one parent is specified (non-NULL), the inferred inheritance dictionary is the same as would be produced by a call to addPatternForClone() with that one parent, for that chromosome, for the determined offspring sex.  If selfing is desired for the inferred inheritance dictionary, pass the same individual for both parent1 and parent2; the behavior of addPatternForCross() in that case is essentially to self the individual, as discussed in that method.  If the inferred inheritance dictionary for a given chromosome is not well-defined, as discussed in the documentation for addPatternForCross() and addPatternForClone(), or if both parent1 and parent2 are NULL, an error will be raised.  In such cases, the inheritance dictionary cannot be inferred, and will need to be given explicitly in pattern."

This method supports several possible configurations for strand1, strand2, and breaks1 (and the same applies for strand3, strand4, and breaks2).  If strand1 and strand2 are both NULL, the corresponding haplosome in the generated offspring will be a null haplosome; in this case, breaks1 must be NULL or zero-length.  If strand1 is non-NULL but strand2 is NULL, the corresponding haplosome in the generated offspring will be a clonal copy of strand1 with mutations added, as from addCloned(); in this case, breaks1 must again be NULL or zero-length.  If strand1 and strand2 are both non-NULL, the corresponding haplosome in the generated offspring will result from recombination between strand1 and strand2 with mutations added, as from addCrossed(), with strand1 being the initial copy strand by default (but see below).  Copying will switch between strands at each crossover breakpoint.  Breakpoints may be supplied in breaks1, which need not be sorted or uniqued (SLiM will sort and unique the supplied breakpoints internally).  Alternatively, breaks1 may be NULL, which requests that addRecombinant() draw breakpoints automatically to recombine strand1 and strand2, following SLiM’s usual breakpoint-drawing algorithm.  (If you do not want any breakpoints, pass integer(0), a zero-length integer vector, for breaks1.)  Finally, it is not currently legal for strand1 to be NULL and strand2 non-NULL; that variant may be assigned some meaning in future.  Again, this discussion applies equally to strand3, strand4, and breaks2, mutatis mutandis.  Null haplosomes may never be passed as any of the four parental strands; pass NULL, not a null haplosome, if that strand is not inherited from.  When modeling a chromosome that is intrinsically haploid, such as the Y, NULL must be passed for strand3, strand4, and breaks2; you cannot supply genetic information for an offspring haplosome that will not exist.  Note that when new mutations are generated by addRecombinant(), their subpopID property will be the id of the offspring’s subpopulation, since the parental subpopulation is ambiguous in the general case; this behavior differs from the other add...() methods. These semantics allow several uses for addRecombinant().  When all strands are non-NULL, it is similar to addCrossed() except that the recombination breakpoints can be specified explicitly, allowing very precise offspring generation without having to override SLiM’s breakpoint generation with a recombination() callback.  When only strand1 and strand3 are supplied, it is very similar to addCloned(), creating a clonal offspring, except that the two parental haplosomes need not belong to the same individual (whatever that might mean biologically).  Supplying only strand1 is useful for modeling clonally reproducing haploids, or any chromosome type that is intrinsically haploid, such as the Y chromosome.  For a model of clonally reproducing haploids that undergo horizontal gene transfer (HGT), supplying only strand1 and strand2 will allow HGT from strand2 to replace segments of an otherwise clonal copy of strand1, while the second haplosome of the generated offspring will be a null haplosome; this could be useful for modeling bacterial conjugation, for example.  Other variations are also possible. The sex parameter optionally specifies the sex of the offspring.  The default value of NULL for sex specifies “default behavior”; in a non-sexual model this is the only legal value, and produces a hermaphroditic offspring.  In a sexual model, the “default behavior” of NULL is that the offspring’s sex is dictated by the haplosome structure it inherits.  For example, if the supplied strands indicate that the offspring will have two non-null haplosomes for a chromosome of type \"X\", the sex of the offspring must therefore be female, whereas if it will have one non-null \"X\" haplosome and one null \"X\" haplosome, it must therefore be male.  SLiM will examine the supplied strands to determine such constraints and enforce them.  The constraints defined by each chromosome type, as described in initializeChromosome(), must always be followed, even when using addRecombinant().  If sex is NULL and the sex of the offspring is unconstrained, the offspring will be chosen as male or female with equal probability.  A value of \"M\" or \"F\" for sex specifies that the offspring should be male or female, respectively.  A float value from 0.0 to 1.0 for sex provides the probability that the offspring will be male; a value of 0.0 will produce a female, a value of 1.0 will produce a male, and for intermediate values SLiM will draw the sex of the offspring randomly according to the specified probability.  In these cases where sex is not NULL, SLiM will first determine the sex of the individual as just described, and will then examine the supplied strands to confirm that it is compatible with the sex that was determined.  Again, if there is a conflict an error will be raised; you cannot specify the sex of an individual to be incompatible with the haplosomes that it inherits, and if you specify a sex with a string or float value it is up to you to ensure that that is compatible with the supplied strands.  (If you need more flexibility, you should probably not use a sexual model at all, but simply use chromosome type \"A\" or \"H\" in a non-sexual model, track the sex of individuals yourself with a tag value such as tagL0, and manipulate haplosomes during reproduction however you wish; SLiM then imposes no constraints.) By default, the offspring is considered to have no parents, since there may be more than two “parents” in the general case.  If specifying parentage is desired, parent1 and/or parent2 may be passed to explicitly; this will establish those individuals as the parents of the offspring for purposes of pedigree tracking, and for several other purposes described below.  If only one of parent1 and parent2 is non-NULL, that individual will be set as both of the parents of the offspring, mirroring the way that parentage is tracked for other cases such as addCloned() and addSelfed().  It is not required for parent1 or parent2 to actually be a genetic parent of the offspring at all, although typically they would be.  To benefit from the full functionality of addRecombinant() as described below, it is best to supply parent1 and parent2 when possible. The randomizeStrands parameter is used to control the recombination behavior of addRecombinant().  As described above, two parental strands with crossover breakpoints between them can be specified to generate one offspring strand with recombination – for example, with the strand1, strand2, and breaks1 parameters, but the same is true of the strand3, strand4, and breaks2 parameters, and the discussion that follows applies to both cases.  If randomizeStrands is F, the supplied strands are used as given; for example, strand1 will be the initial copy strand when generating the first gamete to form the offspring.  This mode should be used if you want explicit control over the initial copy strand; one example would be if your script is explicitly generating all four of the products of a meiosis event.  If randomizeStrands is T, then if strand1 and strand2 are both non-NULL, 50% of the time they will be swapped, making strand2 the initial copy strand for the first gamete instead.  This mode (randomizeStrands=T) is usually the desired behavior, to avoid an inheritance bias due to a lack of randomization in the initial copy strand, so passing T for randomizeStrands is recommended unless you specifically desire otherwise.  The default value of randomizeStrands is NULL in order to force either T or F to be explicitly chosen whenever it would make a difference; if it is left as NULL, an error will be raised if generation of the specified offspring involves recombination, since then SLiM needs to know whether the value is T or F.  (This unconventional approach has been adopted because the default value was F prior to SLiM 5, but T is almost always the correct behavior, as explained above.  To try to prevent accidental bugs, this new policy was adopted to force the user to explicitly choose T or F whenever it matters.) The value of the meanParentAge property of the generated offspring is calculated from the mean parent age of each of its two haplosomes (whether they turn out to be null haplosomes or not); that may be an average of two values (if both offspring haplosomes have at least one parent), a single value (if one offspring haplosome has no parent), or no values (if both offspring haplosomes have no parent, in which case 0.0 results).  The mean parent age of a given offspring haplosome is the mean of the ages of the parents of the two strands used to generate that offspring haplosome; if one strand is NULL then the mean parent age for that offspring haplosome is the age of the parent of the non-NULL strand, while if both strands are NULL then that offspring haplosome is parentless and is not used in the final calculation.  In other words, if one offspring haplosome has two parents with ages A and B, and the other offspring haplosome has one parent with age C, the meanParentAge of the offspring will be (A+B+C+C) / 4, or equivalently, ((A+B)/2 + C) / 2, not (A+B+C) / 3. Callbacks can be involved in offspring generation with addRecombinant(), but because there are up to four strands with up to four different parents, things are a bit complicated and different from other add...() methods; the policy described here seems like the best compromise.  The target subpopulation for the addRecombinant() call will be used to locate applicable mutation() and modifyChild() callbacks governing the generation of the offspring individual.  On the other hand, recombination() callbacks will be found based upon the subpopulations to which parent1 and parent2 belong (for reasons discussed further in drawBreakpoints()); if a parent individual is not supplied, recombination() callbacks will not be called at all when generating the corresponding offspring haplosome. When breakpoints are explicitly supplied to addRecombinant() with breaks1 or breaks2, gene conversion tracts are not well-supported by this method; the breaks1 and breaks2 vectors provide simple crossover breakpoints, which may be used to implement crossovers or simple gene conversion tracts, but complex gene conversion tracts with heteroduplex mismatch repair are not supported in this mode of operation since there is no way to supply the relevant information.  If, on the other hand, breaks1 or breaks2 is NULL when generating a haplosome with recombination, then as described above, addRecombinant() will generate breakpoints internally for that cross, and in this case, complex gene conversion tracts with heteroduplex mismatch repair are supported, since all of the necessary information is available. Beginning in SLiM 4.1, the count parameter dictates how many offspring will be generated (previously, exactly one offspring was generated).  Each offspring is generated independently, based upon the given parameters.  The returned vector contains all generated offspring, except those that were rejected by a modifyChild() callback.  If all offspring are rejected, object<Individual>(0) is returned, which is a zero-length object vector of class Individual; note that this is a change in behavior from earlier versions, which would return NULL. Beginning in SLiM 4.1, passing T for defer requests that the generation of the haplosomes of the produced offspring be deferred until the end of the reproduction phase.  SLiM may or may not honor this request; if not, the offspring will be generated synchronously just as if defer were F.  Haplosome generation can only be deferred if there are no active mutation() callbacks; otherwise, an error will result.  Furthermore, when haplosome generation is deferred the mutations of the haplosomes of the generated offspring may not be accessed until reproduction is complete (whether from a modifyChild() callback or otherwise).  There is little or no advantage to deferring haplosome generation when running single-threaded; in that case, the default of F for defer is generally preferable since it has fewer restrictions.  When running multi-threaded, deferring haplosome generation allows that task to be done in parallel (which is the reason this option exists). Also beginning in SLiM 4.1, in spatial models the spatial position of the offspring will be inherited (i.e., copied) from parent1; more specifically, the x property will be inherited in all spatial models (1D/2D/3D), the y property in 2D/3D models, and the z property in 3D models.  Properties not inherited will be left uninitialized, as they were prior to SLiM 4.1.  The parent’s spatial position is probably not desirable in itself; the intention here is to make it easy to model the natal dispersal of all the new offspring for a given tick with a single vectorized call to deviatePositions() / pointDeviated().  If parent1 is NULL, parent2 will be used; if it is also NULL, no spatial position will be inherited. Note that this method is only for use in nonWF models.  See addCrossed() for further general notes on the addition of new offspring individuals."

The center parameter sets the coordinates of the center of the subpopulation’s displayed circle; it must be a float vector of length two, such that center[0] provides the x-coordinate and center[1] provides the y-coordinate.  The square central area of the Population Visualization occupies scaled coordinates in [0,1] for both x and y, so the values in center must be within those bounds.  If a value of NULL is provided, SLiMgui’s default center will be used (which currently arranges subpopulations in a circle).

The name of the map is given by name, and can be used to identify it.  The map uses the spatial dimensions referenced by spatiality, which must be a subset of the dimensions defined for the simulation in initializeSLiMOptions().  Spatiality \"x\" is permitted for dimensionality \"x\"; spatiality \"x\", \"y\", or \"xy\" for dimensionality \"xy\"; and spatiality \"x\", \"y\", \"z\", \"xy\", \"yz\", \"xz\", or \"xyz\" for dimensionality \"xyz\".  The spatial map is defined by a grid of values supplied in parameter values.  That grid of values is aligned with the spatial bounds of the subpopulation, as described in more detail below; the spatial map is therefore coupled to those spatial bounds, and can only be used in subpopulations that match those particular spatial bounds (to avoid stretching or shrinking the map).  The remaining optional parameters are described below. Note that the semantics of this method changed in SLiM 3.5; in particular, the gridSize parameter was removed, and the interpretation of the values parameter changed as described below.  Existing code written prior to SLiM 3.5 will produce an error, due to the removed gridSize parameter, and must be revised carefully to obtain the same result, even if NULL had been passed for gridSize previously. Beginning in SLiM 3.5, the values parameter must be a vector/matrix/array with the number of dimensions appropriate for the declared spatiality of the map; for example, a map with spatiality \"x\" would require a (one-dimensional) vector, spatiality \"xy\" would require a (two-dimensional) matrix, and a map with spatiality of \"xyz\" would require a three-dimensional array.  (See the Eidos manual for discussion of vectors, matrices, and arrays.)  The data in values is interpreted in such a way that a two-dimensional matrix of values, with (0, 0) at upper left and values by column, is transformed into the format expected by SLiM, with (0, 0) at lower left and values by row; in other words, the two-dimensional matrix as it prints in the Eidos console will match the appearance of the two-dimensional spatial map as seen in SLiMgui.  This is a change in behavior from versions prior to SLiM 3.5; it ensures that images loaded from disk with the Eidos class Image can be used directly as spatial maps, achieving the expected orientation, with no need for transposition or flipping.  If the spatial map is a three-dimensional array, it is read as successive z-axis “planes”, each of which is a two-dimensional matrix that is treated as described above. Moving on to the other parameters of defineSpatialMap(): if interpolate is F, values across the spatial map are not interpolated; the value at a given point is equal to the nearest value defined by the grid of values specified.  If interpolate is T, values across the spatial map will be interpolated (using linear, bilinear, or trilinear interpolation as appropriate) to produce spatially continuous variation in values.  In either case, the corners of the value grid are exactly aligned with the corners of the spatial boundaries of the subpopulation as specified by setSpatialBounds(), and the value grid is then stretched across the spatial extent of the subpopulation in such a manner as to produce equal spacing between the values along each dimension.  The setting of interpolation only affects how values between these grid points are calculated: by nearest-neighbor, or by linear interpolation.  Interpolation of spatial maps with periodic boundaries is not handled specially; to ensure that the edges of a periodic spatial map join smoothly, simply ensure that the grid values at the edges of the map are identical, since they will be coincident after periodic wrapping.  Note that cubic/bicubic interpolation is generally smoother than linear/bilinear interpolation, with fewer artifacts, but it is substantially slower to calculate; use the interpolate() method of SpatialMap to precalculate an interpolated map using cubic/bucubic interpolation. The valueRange and colors parameters travel together; either both are unspecified, or both are specified.  They control how map values will be transformed into colors, by SLiMgui and by the mapColor() method.  The valueRange parameter establishes the color-mapped range of spatial map values, as a vector of length two specifying a minimum and maximum; this does not need to match the actual range of values in the map.  The colors parameter then establishes the corresponding colors for values within the interval defined by valueRange: values less than or equal to valueRange[0] will map to colors[0], values greater than or equal to valueRange[1] will map to the last colors value, and intermediate values will shade continuously through the specified vector of colors, with interpolation between adjacent colors to produce a continuous spectrum.  This is much simpler than it sounds in this description; see the recipes for an illustration of its use. Note that at present, SLiMgui will only display spatial maps of spatiality \"x\", \"y\", or \"xy\"; the color-mapping parameters will simply be ignored by SLiMgui for other spatiality values (even if the spatiality is a superset of these values; SLiMgui will not attempt to display an \"xyz\" spatial map, for example, since it has no way to choose which 2D slice through the xyz space it ought to display).  The mapColor() method will return translated color strings for any spatial map, however, even if SLiMgui is unable to display the spatial map.  If there are multiple spatial maps that SLiMgui is capable of displaying, it choose one for display by default, but other maps may be selected from the action menu on the individuals view (by clicking on the button with the gear icon)."

                "description": " Deviates the spatial positions of the individuals supplied in individuals, using the provided boundary condition and dispersal kernel.  The supplied SpatialMap object (or a string specifying a map by name), map, is used (in addition to the spatial bounds of the subpopulation) to define which positions are considered to be “out of bounds”, as described below.  If individuals is NULL, the positions of all individuals in the target subpopulation are deviated.  This method is essentially an extension of the deviatePositions() method, adding bounds-checking using map; however, there are some differences as described below. The boundary condition boundary must be either \"reprising\" or \"absorbing\".  In the simple case where map values are either 0 (bad habitat) or 1 (good habitat), \"reprising\" means a new location is drawn conditional on falling within the good habitat; \"absorbing\" means individuals falling outside the good habitat are “absorbed” (killed, probably).  The details are discussed below, when map is discussed.  Note that the boundary condition \"none\" is not supported because points must be within the boundaries of the spatial map to be checked.  Reflecting and stopping boundaries are not supported because, with the spatial map, if a drawn point is considered out-of-bounds it is not clear where the “edge” is, and therefore reflecting off of the edge, or stopping at the edge, are not well-defined.  Finally, \"periodic\" is not supported because it does not specify any action to be taken when a drawn point is considered to be “out of bounds” according to the spatial map; instead, this method automatically applies any periodic boundaries that have been defined and then, using the resulting point, checks the subpopulation’s spatial bounds and the spatial map, and applies reprising or absorbing boundaries as requested if the point is “out of bounds”. The spatial map defined by map must be configured in a specific way.  First of all, it must be defined in, or added to, the target subpopulation (and thus, by implication, it must match the spatial bounds of the subpopulation.  Second, its spatiality must be equal to the dimensionality of the species; in an \"xy\" species, for example, the map must also be \"xy\".  Third, the values in the spatial map must represent “habitability”, in the following sense.  The value of map at a given drawn point is obtained, symbolized here by x.  Next, x is clamped to the range [0, 1]; values less than 0 become 0, values greater than 1 become 1.  The resulting x value is then interpreted as the probability that the point is considered “within bounds” (as far as the spatial map is concerned; points that are outside the subpopulation’s spatial bounds are always considered “out of bounds”).  If boundary is \"reprising\", 1-x is thus the probability that the point will be redrawn; if boundary is \"absorbing\", 1-x is thus the probability that the individual will be considered “absorbed”, as discussed below.  In this manner, the concept of “out of bounds” is treated as a probability by this method, rather than a binary state. The spatial kernel type functionType must be one of \"f\", \"l\", \"e\", \"n\", or \"t\", with the ellipsis parameters ... supplying kernel configuration parameters appropriate for that kernel type; see pointDeviated() for further details.  As with pointDeviated(), the ellipsis parameters that follow functionType may each, independently, be either a singleton or a vector of length equal to n.  This allows each individual’s position to be deviated with a different kernel, representing, for example, the movements of individuals with differing dispersal capabilities/propensities.  (However, other parameters such as boundary, maxDistance, and functionType must be the same for all of the points, in the present design.)

The parameter point may contain a single point which is deviated and bounded n independent times, or may contain n points each of which is deviated and bounded.  In any case, each point in point should match the dimensionality of the model – one element in a 1D model, two elements in a 2D model, or three elements in a 3D model.  This method should not be called in a non-spatial model. The dispersal kernel is specified similarly to other kernel-based methods, such as setInteractionFunction() and smooth().  For pointDeviated(), functionType may be \"f\" with no ellipsis arguments ... to use a flat kernel out to maxDistance; \"l\" with no ellipsis arguments for a kernel that decreases linearly from the center to zero at maxDistance; \"e\", in which case the ellipsis should supply a numeric$ lambda (rate) parameter for a negative exponential function; \"n\", in which case the ellipsis should supply a numeric$ sigma (standard deviation) parameter for a Gaussian function; or \"t\", in which case the ellipsis should supply a numeric$ degrees of freedom and a numeric$ scale parameter for a t-distribution function.  The Cauchy (\"c\") kernel is not supported by pointDeviated() since it is not well-behaved for this purpose, and the Student’s t (\"t\") kernel is not allowed in 3D models at present simply because it hasn’t been implemented.  See the InteractionType class documentation for more detailed discussion of the available kernel types and their parameters and probability distribution functions.  For pointDeviated(), the ellipsis parameters that follow functionType may each, independently, be either a singleton or a vector of length equal to n.  This allows each point to be deviated with a different kernel, representing, for example, the movements of individuals with differing dispersal capabilities/propensities.  (However, other parameters such as boundary, maxDistance, and functionType must be the same for all of the points, in the present design.) The random points returned from this method are drawn from the probability distribution that is radially symmetric and has density proportional to the kernel – in other words, at distance r the density is proportional to the kernel type referred to by functionType.  (Said another way, the shape of the cross-section through the probability density function is given by the kernel.)  For instance, the value of the type \"e\" (exponential) kernel with rate a at r is proportional to exp(−ar), and so in 2D, the probability density that this method with kernel type \"e\" draws from has density proportional to p(x, y) = exp(−a sqrt(x2 + y2)), since r = sqrt(x2 + y2) is the distance.  Note that the distribution of the distance is not given by the kernel except in 1D: in the type \"e\" example, the distribution of the distance in 1D is exponential, while in 2D it has density proportional to r exp(−ar) (i.e., Gamma with shape parameter 1).  For another example, the value of the type \"n\" (Normal) kernel at r with standard deviation 1 is proportional to exp(−r2 / 2), and so the density is proportional to p(x, y) = exp(−(x2 + y2) / 2).  This is the standard bivariate Normal, and equivalent to drawing independent Normals for the x and y directions; however, the Normal is the only distribution for which independent draws along each axis will result in a radially symmetric distribution.  The distribution of the distance in 2D with type \"n\" is proportional to r exp(−r2 / 2), i.e., Rayleigh. The boundary condition must be one of \"none\", \"periodic\", \"reflecting\", \"stopping\", or \"reprising\".  For \"none\", no boundary condition is enforced; the deviated points are simply returned as is.  For \"periodic\", \"reflecting\", and \"stopping\", the boundary condition is enforced just as it is by the pointPeriodic(), pointReflected(), and pointStopped() methods; see their documentation for further details.  For \"reprising\", if the deviated point is out of bounds a new deviated point will be chosen, based upon the same original point, until a point inside bounds is obtained.  Note that absorbing boundaries (for which being out-of-bounds is lethal) would need to be implemented in script; this method cannot enforce them.  (Note, however, that the deviatePositions() method of Subpopulation can enforce absorbing boundaries.) Note that for the typical usage case, in which point comes from the spatialPosition property for a vector of individuals, and the result is then set back onto the same vector of individuals using the setSpatialPosition() method, the deviatePositions() method provides an even more efficient alternative."
